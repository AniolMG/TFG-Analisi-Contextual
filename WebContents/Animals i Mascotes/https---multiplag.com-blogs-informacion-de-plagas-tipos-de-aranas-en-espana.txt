Types of Spiders in Spain
JANUARY 16, 2024
Fascinating and often misunderstood creatures, spiders are arachnids, a group that also includes scorpions, mites and ticks. These invertebrates are distinguished by having eight legs and a body segmented into two main parts: the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Unlike insects, spiders do not have wings or antennae. One of the most notable characteristics of spiders is their ability to produce silk, used for various functions, such as building webs, protecting their eggs, and, in some cases, moving through the air.

    Common Spiders in Spain
The spiders common in Spain are a fascinating and diverse group. These species are most frequently found in domestic and natural environments, playing crucial roles in pest control and ecosystem balance. Below is a detailed description of some of the most common species.
According to studies there are  more than 1500 species of spiders in Spain , below I will present a list of some types of spiders found in Spain:
  House Spider (Tegenaria domestica)
The house spider is a common visitor in Spanish homes. With a body that can measure up to 10 mm and legs that extend considerably further, this spider is characterized by its brown color and its ability to weave not very structured webs in corners and behind furniture. It is harmless to humans and feeds on insects such as flies and mosquitoes.
   Wolf Spider or Spanish Tarantula (Lycpsa Tarantula)
The wolf spider (Lycosa tarantula) is a large, hairy spider commonly found in Spain. It has a robust appearance, with hair on its body and legs. This spider is a hunter and does not build webs, instead, it actively hunts its prey, which are usually insects and other small invertebrates. They are known for their aggressive behavior and speed when hunting. 
Long-Legged Spider (Pholcus phalangioides)
If you have long-legged spiders at home and want to get rid of them, take a look at this article:  I have long-legged spiders at home! Details and prevention 
The whip spider (Pholcus phalangioides), also known as the corner spider, is a spider with long legs and a small, oval body, common in Spain. It is frequently found indoors, such as corners of rooms and dark, low-traffic areas, including basements. It spins fine, messy webs to catch surface-walking insects, not to capture flying prey. This spider is docile, cohabits peacefully with humans and helps in pest control by feeding on annoying insects such as mosquitoes and flies. It is harmless to humans.
  Garden Spider (Araneus diadematus)
The garden spider (Araneus diadematus), common in Spain, is distinguished by its medium size and mottled abdomen with cross-shaped patterns. Weavers of orbicular webs, these spiders mainly capture flies, wasps and other flying insects, and are common predators in gardens and wooded areas.
  Water Spider (Argyroneta aquatica)
The water spider (Argyroneta aquatica), unique in its type and found in Spain, is completely aquatic and lives in ponds, streams and lakes. This species has special adaptations for aquatic life, such as trapping air in its abdomen to use it as oxygen underwater. It feeds on insects and small aquatic invertebrates, and builds bubble-shaped silk shelters underwater, where it spends most of its time. It is a rare and fascinating species in its aquatic habitat.
  Cross Spider (Araneus quadratus)
The cross spider (Araneus quadratus), an orbicular species found in Spain, is characterized by cross-shaped patterns on its abdomen. Medium in size, these spiders weave spiral-shaped orbicular webs to capture flying insects. They are nocturnal hunters, building their webs in strategic places for nocturnal capture. During the day, they usually rest in the center of the web and are less active. Common in gardens and wooded areas, they contribute significantly to the control of insect populations.
Black Lace Weaver (Amaurobius ferox)
The Black Suit Weaver Spider (Amaurobius ferox), medium-sized and common in Spain, lives mainly in forested areas and wooden environments such as logs and wooden structures in buildings. They build tubular webs where they wait for their prey, generally insects and small invertebrates. Although venomous, these spiders are not usually dangerous to humans and tend to avoid contact with them.
Closet Spider (Steatoda grossa)
The corner spider (Steatoda grossa), common in Spain, is found in sheltered places such as corners of buildings, basements and sheds. Medium in size, these spiders have a dark, rounded body with light spots on the abdomen. Although they look similar to the black widow, they are not dangerous to humans. They are nocturnal hunters that feed on insects such as flies and mosquitoes, and weave irregular webs that they use as shelter and to capture prey.
Cave Spider (Meta Menardi)
The weaver spider (Meta menardi), belonging to the family Tetragnathidae and found in Spain, is known for its elegance and for spinning vertical webs in moist, shady areas, especially near water such as streams, rivers and lakes. It uses these webs to capture insects, positioning itself in the center to wait for its prey. Despite its impressive appearance, it is harmless to humans and plays an important role in controlling insects in aquatic environments.
  Fiddler Spider (Loxosceles spp.) 
The violin spider, of the genus Loxosceles and present in Spain, is distinguished by its shape similar to a violin. Although small and harmless in appearance, some species have venomous bites. Not all of them are dangerous to humans, but their venom can cause skin necrosis in severe cases. Bites are rare and usually do not result in serious problems.
  Brown Corner Spider (Loxosceles rufescens)
  The brown spider, also known as the recluse spider, is small, about 7 to 12 mm, and is distinguished by its uniform coloration that varies from light to dark brown. Despite its necrotic venom, it rarely bites humans. It prefers dry, dark places, and its presence is an indication of natural insect control in the home.
  Types of Field Spiders in Spain
  Spiral Web Spider (Dictyna pusilla)
Dictyna pusilla is a small spider that often goes unnoticed due to its size, rarely exceeding 3 mm. It is characterized by its brown or olive green color, which allows it to camouflage itself in its natural environment. Prefers habitats with dense vegetation, especially in areas with high humidity. This species is known for its tangled webs found between the leaves and stems of plants, where it traps small insects. Despite its size, it plays an important role in controlling insect populations.
  Crab Spiders (Philodromus Buchari)
The Philodromus buchari, belonging to the running spider family, is known for its speed and agility. This species, which measures around 4-5 mm, has a brown or grayish color with patterns that facilitate its camouflage in tree bark and among rocks. It does not build web to hunt, but rather actively pursues its prey, making it an efficient predator in field ecosystems.
  Jumping Spider ( Salticidae )
The small, active jumping spider (Salticus scenicus) is commonly found in Spain. It is characterized by its ability to make long jumps, thanks to its robust legs and excellent vision provided by large, frontal eyes. These spiders hunt primarily small insects, preferring vertical surfaces such as walls and tree trunks, and are distinguished by actively hunting rather than using webs to catch their prey.
  Tiger spider (Argiope Bruennichi)
The tiger spider (Argiope bruennichi), also known as the wasp spider, is an orbicular species present in Spain, notable for its medium to large size and striking colors, with yellow and black bands on its abdomen, similar to those of a wasp. It spins impressive orb webs, commonly in sunny vegetated areas, to capture flying insects. Although their appearance can be intimidating, these spiders are active predators and are not usually dangerous to humans.
   Types of Black Spiders in Spain
Within the diversity of spiders in Spain, the types of black spiders occupy a special place, both for their distinctive appearance and their unique behavior. Three notable species of black spiders found in Spain are described below.
Bull Spider (Macrothele Calpeiana)
The bull spider, endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, is notable for its considerable size and intense black color. It can reach up to 30 mm in length. It prefers warm, dry climates, living in rocky areas and open forests. This spider builds a funnel-shaped web in cracks or under stones. Although it is large and intimidating in appearance, it is not aggressive towards humans and its bite rarely occurs, being of low toxicity.
European Black Widow Spider (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus)
  The European black widow, one of the spiders best known for its powerful venom, is small but feared. It measures around 15 mm and is distinguished by its shiny black color with red spots on the abdomen. It is found in hot, dry areas, such as stone walls and woodpiles. Despite its notoriety, this spider is shy and avoids contact with humans, and its bites are extremely rare.
False Black Widow (Steatoda paykulliana)
The False Black Widow, often confused with black widows, is a beautiful and lesser-known species. Up to 15 mm in size, it is characterized by its black color and bright patterns on the abdomen, which can include shades of red, yellow and white. This spider is found in shady, damp areas such as basements and garages. Their bite is rare and generally harmless to humans, although it may cause minor discomfort.
