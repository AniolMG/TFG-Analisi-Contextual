Love this place
Seeing the animals as you drive was great then another whole part to walk.. need at least 3 hours if not more.. we went early amd was not to hot.. the hotter it get the more the animal stay in the shade. Also saw the flamingos being feed at 2pm was great so close . My 3 year old loved it.. but got tired on the walk part

Best zoo/animal reserve experience that we’ve ever been to
The animals look healthy and happy with plenty of room to roam. This is what a zoo should be like. The staff is friendly and the experience itself was amazing. Definitely recommend even if it’s out of your way. Well worth the trip and would love to go back.
