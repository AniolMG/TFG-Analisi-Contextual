We've curated a list of timeless men's classic hairstyles guaranteed to stay on-trend throughout 2024. Whether you're after something bold or subtle, you will find a look that resonates with your personal style in this collection. Let's dive in and discover your new favorite! Short Hairstyles for Men Short hairstyles can go from simple, low-key cuts to longer, more striking hairstyles. They're generally also one of the most accessible types of haircuts to work with, but you'll need to frequent your local barbershop if you're looking to keep up with the look. Short Quiff Hairstyles The quiff is one of today’s most popular trending hairstyles — especially among teens and young adult men. It’s a safe pick for anyone looking for a cool hairstyle. Textured Quiff Mohawk “Quiff” refers to hairstyles that combine different aspects of various older hairstyles. It often features aspects of both the flattop and pompadour of the 1950s and/or the mohawk. It effectively takes the best aspects of these styles and combines them, transforming them into something new entirely. When you have a quiff style, its shape is very important. That’s why it’s necessary to have a variety of styling products on hand — especially if you like to be active or spend time outdoors. It’s a fairly demanding shortcut, but it’s well worth it if you ask us. Short Curly Quiff An alternative to the regular quiff, the short curly quiff does more in terms of offering a natural-looking quiff cut. It uses the curly and messy nature of one’s own hair and doesn’t rely so heavily on hair products. Low Undercut Hairstyles Quiffs are good hairstyles for men who want to try going short, but they aren’t the shortest styles on the market. There are, plenty of styles that are even shorter and that require very minimal effort to look good. These styles have an undercut, which is a type of buzz cut that is done on the sides and back of the head. Today, we’re talking about low undercuts, which aren’t as neat and tidy as middle or high fades but are simpler and more natural in appearance. Low Fade & Hard Part If you’re looking to stand out without using your hair, opt for a hard part. As
