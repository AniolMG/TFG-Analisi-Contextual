By Jelena ‚Ä¢ Share @vivaluxuryblog Pulling off a fabulous look doesn‚Äôt involve clothes and shoes only ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure you already know that. In fact, even the best outfit can look rather average if not accessorized properly, while glam, sparkly, expensive dresses look extremely cheap when a person decides to dazzle everybody by adding more glitz than the outfit needs. Well, don‚Äôt worry- I‚Äôve decided to write this post, not because I think you ladies lack taste but because jewelry is a very interesting topic that deserves to be talked about over and over again. And I‚Äôm sure you have a lot of interesting pieces that are eagerly waiting to be worn again! So, here‚Äôs some ideas, tips and rules to think about: Table of contents: MIX METALS LAYER YOUR NECKLACES ADD SOME COLOR AND TEXTURE DON‚ÄôT MIX BIG RINGS YOUR CLOTHES MATTERS A LOT DIAMONDS BE CREATIVE Snapshot Survey Do you prefer texting or calling to communicate? Texting Calling 1 Mix Metals Silver, yellow gold, red gold ‚Äì they all go together so don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment and mix your metals until you find the combination you like. You can wear all your bangles at once or mix stackable rings in ways you‚Äôve never tried out before. The rule that says silver can be worn with silver only is definitely out so oil up your squeaky jewelry boxes and check to see which ones of your long-forgotten pieces can be reused in a completely new, trendy way! UPD: Don't stop at bracelets and rings; layer necklaces of different metals for a chic mixed-media appearance. Short chains can sit alongside longer ones, with varying pendants to add interest. Mix matte and shiny finishes for a play on texture, and remember, balance is key; keep the most eye-catching piece centered to serve as the focal point of your look. Try coupling a thick gold chain with a slender silver charm necklace to make each piece stand out. Your metal medley will create a bold fashion statement that's uniquely you!

That means you can wear more than one necklace and they don‚Äôt even have to be the same length or color. In fact, the more layers you manage to create, the more interesting your style will be. Layer your pearls for a vintage look, combine metals, leather and natural stones for boho or combine chains with charm pendants and lockets for a more modern touch. UPD: Layering necklaces is an easy way to create an interesting look with your jewelry. You can layer different lengths and colors for a unique style. For a classic look, layer pearls, or mix metals, leather, and natural stones for a boho look. For a modern twist, combine chains with charm pendants and lockets. When layering, make sure to choose complementary colors and textures. Try to create a balance between the different pieces, and avoid overcrowding. You can also mix and match different shapes and sizes for a bolder look. For example, layer a chunky statement necklace with a delicate chain, or mix a choker with a longer necklace. When combining jewelry, it's important to consider the occasion. For a formal event, opt for classic pieces like pearls or diamonds. For a casual look, consider colorful pieces like gemstones or beads. You can also mix and match different pieces to create a unique look that reflects your own personal style.
