Always Use Hair Serum Before Styling Your Hair By incorporating this simple step into your hair routine, you can significantly enhance the health and appearance of your hair. By applying a small amount of hair serum, a protective barrier is created around each hair strand, safeguarding it against any potential damage caused by heat styling tools. Additionally, the serum provides nourishment and hydration, ensuring that your hair remains smooth, lustrous, and manageable throughout the day. By making the use of hair serum a regular practice, you can enjoy the benefits of protected, glossy, and healthy-looking hair in the long run. So, remember to reach for your favourite hair serum before styling to achieve the best results and maintain the overall well-being of your precious hair. 2. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb for Hassle-Free Hair Management What type of comb or brush you are using impacts a lot upon your hair. A narrow-bristle comb entangles your hair and exerts extra force to detangle the hair. This is the reason, always go for a wide-tooth comb. Also, choose a wooden comb as it leads to less friction with hairs and your hair remains in a healthy state. Start by combing your hair from the tips, gradually moving upwards towards the roots, delicately untangling any knots along the way. This approach helps prevent unnecessary stress and damage, promoting the strength and health of your hair. 3. Avoid Backcombing to Add Volume to Your Hair Backcombing involves teasing the hair by rubbing the strands in the opposite direction to create additional volume. But this extra volume can cost you far more. Backcombing completely strips the hair fibres and cuticle cells. This damages the hair structure and you’ll end up with frizzy hair with split ends. Give your hair the volume without using backcombing or blow dryer. Instead, try using volumizing products like mousses or root-lifting sprays to achieve volume without damage. 4. Don’t Tie Up Your Hair Very Tightly While tight hairstyles like ponytails and buns can be convenient and stylish, they can cause significant damage to your hair. Constantly pulling your hair tightly can lead to hair loss and thinning. Choose looser hairstyles for girls and boys both to promote better hair health and reduce strain on the hairline and scalp. This allows your hair to breathe and decreases the likelihood of damage. If you prefer to style your hair in a ponytail or bun, opt for hair accessories such as fabric hair ties or scrunchies that are gentle on your hair, preventing any pulling or breakage. 5. Minimize Excessive Blow Drying Undoubtedly, blow drying is the best way to dry hair along with styling. But, its extensive blow drying can make your hair dull, frizzy and cause split ends and flyaways. Restrict your number of blow drying and take care of the following things while doing this procedure: Don’t use hot air to blow dry Hot air while blow dry can extract whole moisture from your hair and make it dry. On the other hand, cold air blow drying might be a little slow but a good option. Must coat the hair before blow drying Apply hair serum or heat protectant spray before blow dry. It prevents hair from damage and any breakage. Your hair remains luscious and shiny. Keep a safe distance between dryer and hair It is one of the must-do while blow drying your hair. Keep a distance of at least 12 inches between the dryer and the hair. This way the risk of hair damage lessens up to a great extent. Always blow dry from roots to ends direction Blow drying from roots to ends is the best method. If you do the procedure from ends to roots, it tends to open hair shaft cuticles, increases entangling and leads to extensive damage. 6. Refrain from Making Messy Buns Messy braided hairstyles and buns are trendy, but they can cause damage if done carelessly. Roughly pulling and tugging on your hair to achieve a messy look can result in breakage and frizz. Instead, make sure to be patient and be gentle when braiding or creating a bun hairstyle. This way, you can prevent unnecessary damage and keep your hair healthy. 7. Avoid Styling or Making Hairdos of Wet Hair Hair is more susceptible to damage when wet, which is why it is recommended to avoid combing wet hair. Also, if you make a bun or any hairdo on wet hair, the chances are high of hair damage and breakage. Your hair becomes more fragile and you end up with crimped, crinkled and frizzy hair. It is advised to apply hair smoothening serum on damp hair, air dry the hair first and then do any hairstyle you want to do. By following this, you can reduce the likelihood of hair breakage and maintain the health of your hair. 8. Don’t Make Hair Extensions a Habit Hair extensions are in trend these days. It gives you the desired hair length and hairstyles in seconds. But, applying hair extensions for a long time can cause pain, itching, inflammation, stretching and pulling of hair. Your roots can become weak. This may also lead to traction alopecia. It is a condition of hair loss that is caused due to consistent pulling or stretching of hair. Repeated tight buns or ponytails may also be a reason. Limit the use of hair extensions and give your natural hair a break to maintain its strength and integrity. 9. Say No to Hair Locks Dreads or hair locks, this is also a kind of trend in the western world and now people in India are also adopting this fashion. But, how hair-friendly or safe is it? The twisting involved in creating and maintaining hair locks can cause breakage and scalp issues. This can make your hair frizzy, crimped, weak and fragile. By opting for alternatives to hair locks that are less harsh on your hair, you can achieve a similar aesthetic without compromising its health. It is crucial to prioritize the well-being of your hair when choosing hairstyles, ensuring that you can enjoy both the desired look and the long-term vitality of your precious hair. 10. Use Hair Rollers with Care Hair rollers can be a great tool for achieving voluminous curls or waves, but it's important to use them with care. It is a heat-free procedure, but it doesn’t mean your hair gets no damage. Hair rollers can cause pulling of hair or sometimes it can entangle the hair which causes hair breakage. So, choose the right size for your desired style and avoid rolling your hair too tightly. When removing the rollers, do so gently and prevent pulling on your hair to avoid damage. 11. Give Your Hair Rest from Styling Before Sleeping Prior to sleeping, it is important to allow your hair to rest by refraining from the use of styling products and tools. Allow your hair to breathe and restore its natural oils overnight. Avoid sleeping with tight hairstyles or hair accessories that may cause tension or friction. To minimize friction and decrease the chances of hair breakage, consider using satin or silk pillowcases or wrapping your hair in a silk scarf. It's all about providing your hair with some much-needed tranquility. Take Away These 11 hairstyle tips are your ticket to achieving fabulous, healthy, and envy-worthy hair.
