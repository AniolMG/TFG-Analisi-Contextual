From fabric and length to color and style, several factors come into play when matching gloves to your wedding dress. ‍ In this blog, we will guide you to the perfect gloves that enhance the beauty of your wedding gown. Here are our best tips! WHAT IS THE STYLE OF YOUR WEDDING DRESS? ‍ Begin by considering the style and design elements of your wedding dress. For example, if you have a vintage-inspired gown, opt for classic lace or satin gloves to complement the overall theme. ‍ For a modern and sleek dress, the most flattering gloves offer clean lines and minimal embellishments. ‍ Keep in mind that gloves should enhance the dress without overpowering it! THE 101 ON GLOVE LENGTH ‍ The length of your gloves should be determined by the style of your dress and the formality of your wedding. ‍ Gloves come in various lengths, from wrist-length to opera-length. For a traditional look, pair a ball gown or a floor-length dress with opera-length gloves. Tea-length or cocktail-style dresses are better suited to wrist-length or elbow-length gloves, while a short dress can be complemented with chic and delicate fingerless gloves. THE KEY TO COLOR COORDINATION ‍ Matching the color of your gloves to your wedding dress is essential to keep with the cohesiveness of the ensemble. ‍ If your wedding dress is pure white, choose gloves in a shade of white that closely matches the gown. For ivory or off-white dresses, select gloves that are closer in to the gown color. If you have a colored wedding dress, consider gloves in a complementary shade or opt for a neutral color like beige or pale gray. FABRICS ‍ Harmonizing the fabrics of your gloves and dress ups the refinement. If your wedding dress is made of lace, consider going with lace gloves that feature a similar pattern. ‍ Satin gloves pair well with satin or silk dresses, while sheer gloves complement lightweight and ethereal fabrics. You want to focus on creating a seamless transition between the glove fabric and the dress material. IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU ‍ In the end, it’s all about your wedding dress and your personal style. Choose the gloves that sing to your heart, and keep you comfortable. ‍ Ensure that the gloves fit well and allow freedom of movement for your hands. Consider the weather and the length of time you'll be wearing the gloves to ensure maximum comfort throughout your special day. ‍ Courtney L.
