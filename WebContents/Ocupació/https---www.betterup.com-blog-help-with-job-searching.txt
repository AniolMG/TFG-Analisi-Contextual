Whatever the reason that brought you back to the job market, know that you’re not alone - many applicants report a shortage of suitable openings. Taking proactive steps to better your situation is commendable, so be proud of yourself for seeking help with job hunting. You’ve probably already explored various resources available to job seekers, such as job boards, networking, and LinkedIn alerts. However, that doesn’t necessarily make the process any easier. The thought of approaching employer booths at job fairs may make you cringe, or you may feel overwhelmed trying to navigate different online job boards. But remember, your determination, readiness to learn, and interest in personal growth will help you overcome job search challenges and bounce back from a job loss. Keep pushing forward! Now, let’s dive into some job search tips that will give you the edge you need to land a great gig without burning yourself out in the process. How long does it usually take to find a job? On average, the length of time it takes for someone to find a job can vary depending on several factors, including the job market, the applicant's qualifications, and the industry they are targeting. Indeed reports that some individuals with in-demand skills may find a job within a few days, while others may experience unemployment for several months before securing a position. A survey conducted by recruiting company Randstad USA suggests that the average length of a modern-day job search is around five months. Joblist.com states that the average job hunt takes approximately a month and a half. TopResume suggests that the average job search can take around five to six months, from the application process to being hired. It's important to note that these figures are averages and can vary depending on individual circumstances. The duration of the job search can be influenced by factors such as the level of competition, the applicant's qualifications and experience, the industry, and economic conditions.

Find your Coach Why create a job-hunting system The importance of a job-hunting system can’t be overstated. Without one, you may end up feeling exhausted and overwhelmed by all the job research, applications, and interviews you have to do. Creating a job search system helps you organize your information in one place — from contacts to resumes to networking notes — so that everything is easy to find when needed. You’ll also want to set realistic goals for yourself. Aim for applying to three to five jobs a week and connecting with at least two people each day, even if it’s just on LinkedIn. Lastly, don’t forget to take care of yourself while job searching. It can be easy to get so caught up that you forget to eat or exercise — but this will only make the entire process harder. Take breaks and set aside time to do something you enjoy. This will help keep your energy up and ensure that you stay motivated throughout the job search journey. With a few simple steps, you can simplify your job hunt and help streamline the process. Make sure to stay organized by keeping a spreadsheet of application tracking, where you can list the job title, company, application date, and interview status. This will help you stay on top of your progress and prioritize tasks.

Top 5 steps to help you find job search success Embarking on a job search can be a challenging endeavor, but it doesn’t have to be a dreaded experience. Here are five indispensable steps that will guide you toward success and help you land your dream job. Self-assessment: Take the time to assess your skills, interests, and career goals. Identify your strengths, areas for improvement and the industries and roles that align with your aspirations. Research and target: Conduct thorough research on the industries and companies you're interested in. Look for job openings, company culture, values, and growth opportunities. Narrow down your targets to focus on organizations that match your goals. Tailor your application materials: Customize your resume, cover letter, and online profiles to highlight your relevant skills and experiences for each job application. Use keywords from the job description to optimize your chances of getting noticed by recruiters. Network and expand connections: Build and leverage your professional network. Attend networking events, connect with industry professionals on platforms like LinkedIn, and engage in relevant conversations. Personal connections can often lead to valuable job leads and referrals. Prepare for and ace interviews: Research the companies you're interviewing with, anticipate common interview questions, and practice your responses. Prepare examples that showcase your skills and accomplishments. Dress professionally, maintain positive body language, and demonstrate enthusiasm during the interview process. Remember, persistence and adaptation are key in a job search. Stay hopeful, follow up after interviews, seek feedback, say thank you, and continue to refine your approach. Each step brings you closer to finding the right job opportunity and a great new role. 30 job hunting tips to get better at job hunting Here’s the first thing you should know: there’s no one best way to find a job. Different strategies work for different job seekers in different industries. What works wonders for you and your career might have zero impact on the next person. When you’re ready to get back out there, these tips can be applied to just about any job search: 1. Keep your resume updated This one might be a no-brainer but don’t neglect your resume, even if you’re unemployed. Add every relevant volunteer opportunity or certificate to help your resume stand out. If you feel your career gap is something to hide, think again — most people have had a gap in their work experience. And if you address it honestly, potential employers may even see your career gap as a plus. That was the time you spent learning. Once you land that job, keep updating your resume as new experiences and achievements pop up — you’ll thank yourself the next time you’re ready to hit the job market. 2. Tailor your application to each job Don’t send the same boilerplate cover letter and resume to every job you apply for — you won’t get away with it. Big companies use applicant tracking systems to sift through applications and weed out candidates who don’t fit what the algorithm’s looking for. Look closely at the job description and see what desired skills they list. Make sure you highlight the ones you share on your resume so you don’t fall through the cracks. Adjusting the phrasing of these skills or accomplishments to match the job’s requirements will help your application land on top. 3. Tidy up your social media Like it or not, recruiters do look at social media. One Harris Poll survey even found that 71% of hiring managers consider social media an effective screening tool. Take a close look at what the public can see on your social media platforms, like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram. Are your profiles an accurate representation of who you are? More importantly, is your content appropriate, or would a recruiter balk at your posts? Making your profiles private might help you limit potential employers from seeing anything you don’t want to share. 4. Hit up your network Tap into your network to get yourself on the map. It’s a great way to learn about new job openings, get valuable career advice, and widen your perspective on your industry. Your network is full of other industry professionals, so chat them up — and don’t be too shy to say you’re looking for a new job. If they know you’re looking, someone in your network might pass along a job listing that matches your interests and skills. 5. Be yourself You have a great personality — let it shine. Walk into every interview (including the virtual ones) ready to convey your authentic character. Hiring managers want to know who you are as a person, not just as an employee. Keep it professional, but don't be boring or passive. Remember to smile and be personable as you answer interview questions. You’re not a robot, so don’t act like one. 6. Practice self-care Inhale, exhale. You might finish the day feeling exhausted, drained, or anxious. But your personal mental health and well-being should always be top priorities. Incorporating self-care into your routine will help recharge your batteries as you look for a new job. Consider taking a nice walk in nature, reading your favorite book, or listening to calming music — anything to help decompress after a busy day of job hunting. 7. Build a professional online presence Creating a professional LinkedIn profile is an essential part of the job search process. It helps you stand out from other candidates and makes it easier for recruiters to find you. Share relevant details about your experiences, skills, and accomplishments when crafting your profile. Make sure that your profile accurately reflects your professional brand. 8. Attend networking events Attend industry-specific events, job fairs, and career expos to meet potential employers and expand your professional network. Prepare an elevator pitch and bring business cards to make a memorable first impression. 9. Network online Join industry-specific groups and forums online to connect with professionals in your field. You can offer to grab a coffee (in-person or virtually) and set up informational interviews with individuals holding your dream roles. Engage in discussions, share insights, and build relationships that may lead to job opportunities. 10.
