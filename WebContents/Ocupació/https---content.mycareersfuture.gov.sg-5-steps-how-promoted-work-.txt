With determination and commitment to self-improvement, anyone can step up in their careers with these tips. Promotions at work are usually based on merits. To reach this milestone, you’ll need to prove and convince your boss that you’ve got what it takes to advance in your current role. Besides taking on additional projects or more responsibility, you’ll also need to actively show interest to move up in your company. By taking these five practical steps, you’ll be increasing your chances of moving ahead in your career sooner than you think! Five ways to tell your boss you’re ready for a promotion 1. Live the values and purpose of your organisation A strong business leader is someone who understands and is aligned with the values of their organisation. Not only do they strive to demonstrate these values and ethics in their everyday work interactions, but they also encourage others to uphold these values. As Simon Sinek, a British-American author and inspirational speaker, said, “People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.” Leaders inspire others to join them on their journeys as they work towards meeting the business’s purpose and achieving consistent results. You can display this leadership by ensuring your actions at work always reflect the core purpose of the organisation. This demonstrates to your employers that you are committed to delivering effective results aligned with business values, and are also a good role model for your colleagues.

Volunteer to lead Another way to show your boss that you’re ready for a promotion is to volunteer to lead a new project or challenge. Employees who rise to the occasion, rather than stick to simple work tasks, display promising leadership traits such as having high levels of self-motivation, initiative and accountability. Showing that you have the skills and qualities of an emerging leader will help you get promoted at work quickly. If you see an area at work where you believe you can add great value and provide strategic support, don’t be afraid to raise your hand and offer your help. Asking your boss for opportunities to showcase your abilities will also effectively signal your enthusiasm for the organisation. In the process, you’ll be able to acquire new skills. This is also the best way to gain leadership experience while fostering better relationships with your colleagues to prepare you for the next role. When you ask to participate in an opportunity outside your normal role, explain why you believe you can make a positive contribution and assure that it will not affect the quality of your existing work. You should also discuss how you think the new opportunity will help prepare you for your next step with the organisation. 3. Be team-oriented and results-focused Working collaboratively and offering your time and support to help the entire team succeed are invaluable traits that a company looks for in a good business leader. A good leader acts as a guidance partner who helps others realise their true potential. Employees who are willing to work with the team to overcome challenges together while demonstrating a strong desire and ability to solve problems will be recognised by their bosses. Not only are you dependable in the eyes of your employer, but your boss will be more confident in giving you more responsibilities, knowing that they do not have to worry about your capabilities, or your ability to work with others to achieve a common goal.

Don’t underestimate professionalism Although the workforce continues to work from home, we shouldn’t underestimate the power of maintaining a high level of professionalism. Being neatly groomed, whether you’re behind the camera or in-person, and appropriately dressed for the office, will highlight your respect for the workplace and commitment to cultivating a professional work culture. You should always be self-aware when you’re at work and not do things that your boss wouldn’t, such as indulging in gossip or missing deadlines. If you want to be recognised for your work, you will need to demonstrate a strong work ethic and be respectful to others. When there is mutual respect in the workplace, you will also face less friction when the news of your job promotion is announced as others will see it as well-deserved. 5. Converse with your boss There’s no perfect or right time to ask for a promotion. When you feel like you are ready and capable of taking a higher position, the best thing to do is just to ask for a promotion nicely. Your boss might have missed all the signs and you have to let them know that you’re committed to the job and ready for the next step in your career. It’s important to have an open and honest conversation with your boss or manager about your ambitions and performance. When you share your career goals with your bosses, they can better help identify your key strengths and guide you to where you want to be. Based on how they see your career progressing, you and your boss can develop a plan together involving increasing levels of responsibilities that will support your long-term goals.
