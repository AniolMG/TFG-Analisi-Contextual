However, by following these five essential tips, you can make your search for a new home much easier and more manageable. 1. Calculate your budget Setting a budget is an essential step in finding your ideal home. To make this process easier, begin by assessing your monthly earnings and any additional sources of income. Next, evaluate your expenses, such as debts and other financial obligations. Take into account your liquid assets, such as savings, that can be allocated to your housing costs. Checking your credit score is also crucial because it impacts your ability to secure financing options. Use these factors to calculate a realistic budget that aligns with your financial situation and goals. Also consider using online resources, like our mortgage calculator, to assist you in this process. » LEARN: How to make a moving budget 2. Determine if you want to buy or rent Decide whether you prefer to buy or rent your next home. Renting can give you the flexibility to explore a new area and save money for a future home; however, your rent costs are not building equity. Buying is a significant commitment that requires thorough research and higher upfront costs, but your monthly payments build toward ownership. » MORE: Renting vs. buying a house 3. Decide where you want to live Take some time to reflect on the city or town that best suits your needs and preferences. Factors worth considering include the area’s cost of living and proximity to schools, work and family. Explore an area you are considering moving to at various times of day to get a sense of noise levels, traffic patterns, cell service, access to grocery stores and health care facilities and the overall atmosphere. Try envisioning yourself in this location for an extended period of time (maybe five years or more). Because moving can be strenuous, it’s wise to avoid places that don’t align with your long-term desires — you might not want to relocate again in the near future. » MORE: The 10 states with the lowest cost of living 4. Decide if you want a house, apartment or condo Consider your lifestyle and budget when deciding between a house, apartment or condo (or other type of dwelling). If you desire city life, an apartment or condo might be more suitable for you. On the other hand, if you value more space and amenities like a yard, a house might be the ideal choice. Pinpointing the type of dwelling you prefer will significantly narrow your options and guide your search throughout the process. » MORE: Buying a condo vs. a house 5.

Researching your new community It's beneficial to thoroughly research the community you'll be living in to avoid any regrets. Some factors to consider include: Safety and crime rates: Take the time to research the safety of the area you’re considering. Look up crime statistics on the city’s official website, and visit the neighborhood to gauge your comfort level. Commute: Evaluate the distance and traffic conditions if you’ll be commuting by car, or assess the availability of a convenient public transportation system. Find the best route to your workplace to ensure a feasible daily commute. Schools: If you have children, explore the schools in the area. Look for school rankings, standardized test scores and reviews from other parents. Arrange a meeting with the principal and schedule a classroom visit to get a better sense of the school’s atmosphere. Community: Consider the features that are significant to you and your family. These may include access to libraries, parks, places of worship, a diverse population, a vibrant nightlife or an arts district. Take the time to determine which aspects of the community are important to you and your family, and ensure that the area has what you’re looking for. Home adaptability: If you plan to stay in your new home for an extended period, envision how your family or lifestyle might evolve over time. Assess if the house can accommodate your long-term plans and potential changes. » MORE: Safest cities in the U.S. What to do once you find your dream home Finding your next home is only the first step.
