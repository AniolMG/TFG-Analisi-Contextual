Write Sign up Sign in BERT vs GPT: A Tale of Two Transformers That Revolutionized NLP Tavva Prudhvith ¬∑ Follow 4 min read ¬∑ Jul 30, 2023 76 Clash of the Language Titans: BERT and GPT‚Äôs Epic Battle for NLP Supremacy Introduction Two cutting-edge AI models, BERT and GPT, enter the arena of natural language processing (NLP), each with its own unique abilities and strengths. As they face off, the world watches in awe, witnessing a transformative era in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In this article, let us explore the astonishing capabilities of these two models, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Prepare to be amazed as we delve into the depths of their design, origins, and the impact they have left on NLP tasks. Chapter 1: The Birth of Two Titans Once upon a time, in a world of AI research, the Transformer architecture was born, revolutionizing the way we approach NLP. The year was 2017, and the impact of this invention would soon be felt across the globe. Enter BERT and GPT, two mighty models built upon the foundations of this powerful architecture, that learn context from text using attention mechanisms in an unsupervised manner. Chapter 2: BERT, the Context Whisperer In the blue corner, hailing from the laboratories of Google AI, BERT emerged as a pre-trained language model capable of incredible feats. Its secret weapon? You got it right buddy!!! The power to understand context bidirectionally, from both left-to-right and right-to-left, granting it a comprehensive grasp of language. BERT trained tirelessly using masked language modeling, honing its skills to predict missing words in a sentence. With its newfound knowledge, BERT went on to conquer numerous NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question-answering, setting new records and leaving competitors in the dust. Chapter 3: GPT, the Master Wordsmith In the red corner, crafted by the geniuses at OpenAI, GPT entered the scene, armed with a unidirectional approach to text processing.Though it only analyzed text from left to right, GPT displayed an uncanny ability to generate text, weaving coherent and contextually relevant sentences with the finesse of a master wordsmith. Trained in the art of causal language modeling, GPT learned to predict the next word in a sentence, sharpening its text generation prowess. With these skills, GPT dazzled the world with its text generation and completion capabilities, leaving many speechless. They, however, have different architectures and training schemes making them suitable for different categories of NLP tasks. Chapter 4: The Showdown: BERT vs GPT As the world looked on, it was time to compare these two titans and their unique abilities: Training objectives: BERT is trained to predict masked words based on the context provided by other words. On the other hand, GPT is trained to predict the next word in a sentence given previous words through language modeling. Context direction: The B in BERT stands for ‚Äòbidirectional‚Äô üîÅ. BERT scans a sentence from left to right and right to left while making predictions allowing it a deeper understanding of context and meaning, while GPT‚Äôs unidirectional approach focused on left-to-right processing. Model architecture: BERT consists of a single encoder model that are pre-trained jointly, one for the masked language modeling task(MLM) i.e., the MLM task involves predicting masked words within a sentence, and the other for the next sentence prediction(NSP) task. In contrast, GPT consists of a stack of transformer blocks, where each block has multiple self-attention layers and feedforward layers. Training Techniques: BERT honed its skills through masked language modeling, predicting missing words. GPT, on the other hand, excelled at causal language modeling, predicting the next word in a sentence. Finetuning: Both models necessitate substantial amounts of textual data for fine-tuning. Despite the possibility of having open-source model weights (which is not always the case), the sheer number of parameters makes the process computationally demanding and costly. Nevertheless, BERT can be fine-tuned using available GPUs on cloud or server resources, making it more accessible and manageable for researchers and developers. Battle Arenas: Accordingly, BERT can be more suited to tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification, where the model needs to understand the relationships between different parts of a sentence, while GPT, on the other hand, emerged victorious in text generation especially natural-sounding text and completion challenges, , summarization, and language translation (I think everyone can see this in ChatGPTüôå). Conclusion: A Legacy of Innovation In this tale of two transformers, BERT and GPT, we have witnessed an incredible journey of innovation and impact. As these models continue to push the boundaries of NLP and AI, the world watches in awe, eagerly anticipating what the future holds. Aspiring AI researchers and enthusiasts, let this story of rivalry and achievement inspire you to explore the depths of these revolutionary models, and perhaps, one day, contribute to the ever-evolving field of AI.
