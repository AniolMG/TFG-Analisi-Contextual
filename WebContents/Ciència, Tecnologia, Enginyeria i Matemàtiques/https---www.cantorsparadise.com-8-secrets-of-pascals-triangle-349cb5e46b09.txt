Despite being named after 17th century French mathematician Blaise Pascal, it was actually discovered by Chinese mathematician Jia Xian in the 11th century. Taught to millions of high schoolers worldwide as a representation of the coefficients in a binomial expansion, but did you know that it also has a few lesser known properties that lie just under the surface? via Desmos 1) Sums This is the most basic property of Pascal’s triangle Every number is equal to the sum of the 2 numbers above it. This is the easiest way in which Pascal’s triangle can be generated — repeatedly adding the cells in a layer in order to generate the layer below. via Geo-Numerology This is fine for the first few layers, but it can get extremely tedious very quickly as the row length and the numbers in the row both increase. 2) Fibonacci Series Another secret of Pascal’s Triangle is the presence of the Fibonacci series, the series where each number is equal to the sum of the two preceding value. To find this series, you have to draw “shallow diagonals” through the triangle, starting from the top and moving bottom. The sum of these shallow diagonals are the terms in the Fibonacci series, starting with 1 and continuing down the triangle. via Britannica Due to the symmetrical nature of the triangle, these diagonals can be drawn in the other direction as well, producing the same results. 3) Powers of 2 As you go down the triangle, the sum of the rows are equal to increasing powers of 2. The sum of the numbers in the nth row of Pascal’s triangle is equal to 2^n (starting with row 0). via JavaTPoint For example, the sum of the numbers in the first row is 1, or 2⁰. The second row is 2 = 2¹, the third row is 4 = 2², and so on. 4) Number Sequences Pascal’s Triangle can be broken up into columns which start at any term in the right edge and continue through the terms to the direct bottom right to it. Each column has values of a different number sequence. The columns of Pascal’s triangle have values of a different numerical series in which the common difference increases by the column value from term to term. via Cuemath The numbers in the second diagonal are the natural numbers, or the “counting numbers”. If you extend this diagonal, you will get all of the positive integers. The numbers in the third diagonal are the triangular numbers, with the formula n(n + 1)/2. The numbers in the fourth diagonal are the tetrahedral numbers, which you can read more about here. 5) Squares If you take any number in the second column (the counting numbers), the square of the number is equal to the sum of the numbers on its right and bottom right. via USU Take the example of the number 4 in the 5th row. 4 * 4 = 16, which is equal to 6 (the number to its right) plus 10 (the number to its bottom-right). This works for any number in the second column. 6) Sierpinski Triangle The Sierpinski Triangle is definitely one of my favourite properties of Pascal’s triangle. A fractal is a shape that is infinitely repeated, no matter how small/large it is. If you zoom into a fractal, you will discover a smaller version of the original image, which continues forever. This means that fractals can never be physically constructed, as every physical object can only have changes larger than a single atom. This causes fractals to be entirely theoretical, as one can never exist within our understanding of space. via FractalFoundation Suppose every odd number is shaded in. On the triangle above, you might just about be able to see a fractal — every triangle is divided into 4 sub-triangles. This fractal is known as a Sierpinski triangle. via Wikipedia 7) Binomial Expansion This is probably the use that most people are familiar with. The rows in Pascal’s triangle are the values of the coefficients in a binomial expansion. via Maths at Home The values in the nth row of Pascal’s triangle (starting from 0) represent the coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^n. via OnlineMathLearning This provides an easy way to calculate the terms in a binomial expansion without having to expand multiple brackets. For example, in (a + b)^2, the sum of the exponents across all terms in two. In the first term, x^2 and y^0, giving us a sum of two. In the second term, x^1 and y^1, and in the final term, x^0 and y^2. The sum of the exponents in each term is 2, which is equal to the power to which the binomial was initially raised. Then, all you have to do is multiply each of the terms with the corresponding coefficient to get the final terms. 8) Combinatronics In how many different ways can r objects be chosen from n objects? Let’s suppose you have 3 objects — A, B, C, and D. You want to choose 3 objects. We can represent them using the values n and r → n = 4 and r = 3. How many different ways are there to choose 3 objects from your set? We could just list out all of the possible combinations. ABC ABD ACD BCD There are 4 ways to choose 3 objects from a group of 4. The formula to calculate the answer to the question above for any values of n and r is via Stilleducation If we substitute n = 4 and r = 3 from earlier, we get Surprisingly, these values show up in Pascal’s triangle as well! The rth value in the nth row from the top (both starting from 0) is equal to nCr. Pascal’s triangle may seem like just a triangle of numbers, but it has many secrets that lie just underneath the surface. There are many other characteristics, ranging from the fields of trigonometry to the Golden Ratio. If you find any more, please don’t hesitate to leave them in the comments. PS: Generating Pascal’s Triangle To quickly generate Pascal’s triangle to any number of layers (provided you have a screen wide enough!), try out this snippet of code. def generate_triangle(n): # n >= 1 if n == 1: layers = [[1]] elif n == 2: layers = [[1], [1, 1]] else: layers = [[1], [1, 1]] current = 2 while current <= n: next_layer = [1] for i in range(current — 1): block = layers[-1][i] + layers[-1][i + 1] next_layer.append(block) next_layer.append(1) layers.append(next_layer) current += 1 max_ = " ".join([str(i) for i in layers[-1]]) for line in layers: printed = " ".join([str(i) for i in line]) spaces = int((len(max_) — len(printed))/2) print(spaces* " " + printed + spaces* " ") Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.
