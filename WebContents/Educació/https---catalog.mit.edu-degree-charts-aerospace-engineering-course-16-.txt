General Institute Requirements (GIRs)
The General Institute Requirements include a Communication Requirement that is integrated into both the HASS Requirement and the requirements of each major; see details below.
Summary of Subject Requirements Subjects
Science Requirement 6
Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement; at least two of these subjects must be designated as communication-intensive (CI-H) to fulfill the Communication Requirement. 8
Restricted Electives in Science and Technology (REST) Requirement [can be satisfied from among 6.100A/16.C20[J] or 6.100B, 6.3700, 16.001, and 18.03 in the Departmental Program] 2
Laboratory Requirement (12 units) [can be satisfied by 16.405[J], 16.821, or 16.831[J] in the Departmental Program] 1
Total GIR Subjects Required for SB Degree 17
Physical Education Requirement
Swimming requirement, plus four physical education courses for eight points.
Departmental Program
Choose at least two subjects in the major that are designated as communication-intensive (CI-M) to fulfill the Communication Requirement.

Units in Major 180-186
Unrestricted Electives 48
Units in Major That Also Satisfy the GIRs (36)
Total Units Beyond the GIRs Required for SB Degree 192-198
The units for any subject that counts as one of the 17 GIR subjects cannot also be counted as units required beyond the GIRs.
1
Combination of 6.100A Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python and 16.C20 Introduction to Computational Science and Engineering or 6.100B Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science counts as a REST.
2
 18.032 Differential Equations is also an acceptable option.
3
For students who wish to complete an option in aerospace information technology, 36 of the 48 units must come from subjects other than 16.100, 16.20, 16.50, or 16.90.
