Welcome to the FES Website!
Flanders is a neighborhood school located in the heart of Southington. We are located in a lovely rural setting that allows for plenty of open space along with trees and gardens.

Our staff is a mixture of youth and maturity that gives our educational community a wonderful balance. Our students come from many different walks of life and cultural backgrounds that help us to discover the uniqueness of every child.

Our parents have a strong commitment to participating in their children's education. This is demonstrated through our active PTO, high participation in all parent conferences and high attendance at school functions.

It is our goal that as our students progress through the years here that they will reach their full potential as learners, artists, musicians, athletes and citizens in our greater community of Southington, Connecticut.
