About us
We’ve been a specialist university focusing on art, design, media and performance since 1883.
With just over 3,000 students based on our single campus, we’re a close-knit community of creative and collaborative innovators, who all share a common commitment to the arts. We invest heavily in our teaching facilities to provide students with everything needed to fulfil their creative potential and thrive as graduates.
You’ll be taught by our course teams who are experts in their fields, bringing years of industry experience into a unique and creative academic environment.
Courses are delivered through a range of methods, including studio practice; lectures; screenings; seminars (staff and student-led); group presentations and critiques; and external visits to galleries, theatres and exhibitions.

What makes us different
Our courses are designed to equip you with the skills and knowledge to succeed in today’s changing economy. Our facilities support this approach – they’re state-of-the-art and in parallel with current creative industry practice.
 We’re committed to studio-based learning, so every undergraduate course has its own studio space. More importantly, all these courses sit alongside each other on our single campus, and unlike many other art schools, are open access to all students across the university – whatever their chosen course. The openness underpins the cross-discipline respect and understanding that’s fundamental to the successful collaboration and the blended careers which typify the creative industries. It also means our graduates leave with a ready-made network of peers to support their career journey.
