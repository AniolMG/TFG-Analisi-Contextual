Check out our top 10 online casino tips and tricks for players to improve your chances of winning. We’ll show you which games you can win the most from, and how to take advantage of free bonus cash. Swing the odds in your favour 1. Swing the odds in your favour Knowing the odds of a game is essential but delving a bit deeper gives you an extra edge. Spend some time learning the strategies and get to grips with the probabilities of your chosen game. You’ll soon be rewarded by a growing account balance. 2. Earn VIP and high roller rewards Aside from winning big on games, do you know how to make money at the casino? If you’re a regular gambler playing with big sums, you might be entitled to extra bonuses or cash. VIP programs reward high rollers with special perks like cashback and loyalty gifts including electronics, bonuses and even vacations. Check the details for your casino and sign up right away. 3. Increase your chances of becoming the next millionaire Do a little research and see how big a jackpot usually is when it’s won. That way you can time your play just right to increase the likelihood of a big win. 4. Learn how to beat casinos at their own game In blackjack the house edge can be whittled down to just 0.05% by using a good blackjack strategy, but slots have a 3-6% house edge which a player can never overcome. Stick to games where your skill can give you an advantage over the casino – use our best strategy for roulette guide in roulette for example. 5. Spend less, play more The best way to win money at a casino is to play smart. Don't play £10 slot spins if you're on a £50 budget because you'll run out of money before you barely started. Instead play small £1 spins to make your gaming sessions longer and more enjoyable. Playing £1 spins also gives you 50 chances to collect cash, whereas you'll only have 5 shots at picking up any money if you play £10 spins. 6. Don’t buy into superstitions Online casinos and their software use random number generators (RNGs) to make sure that every card dealt and every spin of the reels is completely decided by chance. Don't get sucked into becoming superstitious because there's simply no way to control a game's outcome. Just sit back and enjoy the cash grabbing opportunities as they come. 7. Learn how to gamble online efficiently To gamble online and have a better chance of winning, you need to have focus. One way of improving your focus is by taking regular breaks. You won’t be able to concentrate if you’re tired or playing repetitively. You could also try setting yourself a time limit for gambling online. 8. Know your bonus requirements Most players don't read the bonus terms. You should. That way you'll know exactly how much you'll need to wager before you can cashout. Free cash from online casino bonuses is what makes gambling on the internet better than gambling in real life. So be sure to shop around to find the best bonuses. 9. Avoid shady sites Make sure you are always playing at legitimate, trusted casino sites. Winning big at a casino is only great when you can actually get your hands on the money. That’s why you should never play at untrustworthy casinos. For guaranteed safety, check out our list of real money casinos. 10. Drinking almost guarantees a loss This might seem obvious, but alcohol and gambling do not mix well. Having a drink before or during play at any casino will dull your decision-making skills and you could land up spending money you shouldn't. Don't drink and play. 5 bonus tips 1. Become a pro for free Try out games for free before you spend a cent. You’ll be able to work out what games you’re good at and get to know the way they work too. 2. Betting systems are like unicorns In other words, real betting systems don’t exist. No matter what anyone tells you, there’s no way to guarantee you’ll make a profit gambling online. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true then it usually is. 3. How much risk is too much? You should decide how much risk you want to take before you place a bet. Betting more on games means that when you do win, you’ll earn more money. The downside is you’ll lose more when your luck doesn’t hold through. 4. Stay 100% secure Look for the eCOGRA certificate on an online casino homepage before you sign up. This stamp of approval lets you know that the site is legal and safe. eCOGRA is the online gambling industry’s independent regulator and they evaluate online casinos to make sure they’re secure for players. 5. Calmness is the key to winning Stay calm and don’t stress out if something unexpected happens in a game. Keeping your cool will help you to make solid choices and make you more capable of winning regularly.
