You should. When you’re about to choose your preferred online casino, you shouldn’t blindly trust any shortlist that comes your way. You should trust a safe online casino resource that has your best interests at heart. As a leading brand in the industry, our mission is to be just that for you. We provide an overview here of what our casino review process involves: Safety and Security We always kick off our best online casino reviews with license checks. All our approved gambling sites must hold a valid casino license. The top online casinos will be licensed by trusted authorities. These include the likes of the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) and the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). If the casino site holds multiple licenses, we give it extra points. After licensing, we move on to security. Nothing beats having your cash and personal info fully protected from fraudsters and third parties. The best online casino will keep your data safe with SSL and TSL encryption. Another security measure we look out for is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The best online casino is: licensed by one established gambling authority or more. The best online casino is not: a rogue site with no valid license in place to operate. Online Casino Bonuses Most gamblers would agree that if an online casino doesn’t feature bonuses that give you the best bang for your buck, it’s a dealbreaker. We’re on the same page. We expect the best online casino sites to offer an attractive welcome bonus to their new players. A generous welcome bonus package is always a great start to your online gambling journey. This is especially true if it’s a match bonus paired with free spins, which is a combo we actively look out for during our reviews. Beyond the sign-up bonus, we prioritize regular casino bonuses at online gambling sites. We make sure our top real money online casinos dish out cashback deals, reload bonuses, and loyalty perks on a weekly basis. Aside from checking quantity, we read the fine print to ensure you’re getting a genuine deal. The best online casino is: giving you extra value with their online casino bonus selection. The best online casino is not: a shady site with even shadier promotional terms and conditions. Online Casino Games The best online casinos will stock countless games. We know one player’s preferences will be different to the next, which is why we think variety is important. Online slots are constantly on our radar during reviews. We wouldn’t recommend an online casino if it didn’t include classic slot machines and modern video slots from renown software providers. Great examples can be found with top titles from RTG, EGT Games and many others here on VSO. Fans of table games aren’t excluded from the equation. You’ll find casino staples like blackjack, baccarat, and roulette at our best gambling sites. Video poker, speciality games, and sports betting are generally on offer, too. Due to the popularity of live casino games, no site on this list comes without a live dealer lobby. The best online casino is: packed with games from trusted industry giants like Microgaming, IGT, and Playtech. The best online casino is not: a lacklustre site that doesn’t offer much choice for real money play. Casino Deposit Methods With online casinos, one of the biggest pet peeves for gamblers is not being able to deposit with their favourite banking option. Thankfully, the top-rated online casinos let you deposit and withdraw with multiple payment methods. Whether you want to use your credit card or do a bank transfer, our recommended sites have got you covered. To get shortlisted on this page, casinos must also feature more modern payment options like e-wallets and cryptocurrencies. It may come as no surprise, but we love to cash out our winnings quickly, hassle free. We only list the best online casinos that payout fast here. The best online casino is: a site that will make transactions easy for you, with no fees involved. The best online casino is not: meant to stall on withdrawals or include hidden charges. Customer Support Options Issues can crop up even at the most trusted online casinos. What’s important is how a gambling site handles them. The top sites in the online casino industry will have round-the-clock customer support. We expect casinos to help you in a professional manner, whether you’re contacting them via phone, live chat, or email. When we review the best casinos online, we personally reach out to the support team. This way, we can see first-hand whether the agents are knowledgeable and friendly. Unanswered questions or rude replies are massive red flags. We would never promote such sites and often they’ll end up on our online casino blacklist. The best online casino is: reachable 24/7 through several contact options, including live chat. The best online casino is not: one that disregards the questions or concerns of its members. Mobile Casino Optimization These days, it’s rare for gamblers to limit themselves to their desktop PCs. In fact, the popularity of mobile casino gambling is on the rise and shows no sign of slowing down. A serious online casino operator will have its site optimized for multiple devices. These include iPhones, Android smartphones, iPads, and tablets. Device optimization guarantees you’ll have a sleek and smooth gambling experience, even when you’re out and about. Many of the best mobile online casinos on our list are instant play sites. This means you can simply log in on your mobile browser and play immediately. Other recommended sites also have dedicated gambling apps which you can download from the Google Play Store or the Apple Store. The best online casino is: mobile friendly, and sleek and fast on any device as a result. The best online casino is not: limited to desktop PCs or laptops due to outdated technology. Getting Started at the Best Online Casinos Now that you’re familiar with the factors that make up a good casino, we’ll cover the basics of online gambling, which are mostly similar across all sites. Read our step-by-step guide below before playing at one of our top rated online casinos in Spain . How to Sign Up How to Deposit How to Play How to Win How to Cash Out The Authorities That License the Top Casinos Online So far, we’ve discussed how our best online casinos are overseen by trusted authorities. Their job is to protect players in a lot of jurisdictions. For online casinos to get a license and keep it, they must follow strict rules. These rules, for example, prevent underage gambling. If licensing rules aren’t followed, casinos risk getting fined or suspended. You’ll only get the safest online gambling experience by playing at regulated casinos. If internal gambling is legal where you live, then you’re better off visiting casinos that are licensed locally. We know, however, that many countries don’t allow online gambling, or it exists in a legal grey area. In these cases, players should still opt for licensed sites The difference is that the regulator would be based overseas. This is the case, for example, with the best USA online casinos. We provide a quick overview of the most important gambling authorities around the world below. Look for their logos in the website footer of online casinos. Malta Gaming Authority Year established: 2001 Licensed operators: 400+ The Malta Gaming Authority(MGA) is one of the most respected authorities globally. Its main goal is to create a safe space for online gamblers and promote responsible gaming. It also aims to keep the industry free of money laundering and other crimes. United Kingdom Gambling Commission Year established: 2007 Licensed operators: 450+ The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) oversees the UK market. It is the strictest gambling commission globally, so online casinos with a UKGC license are some of the safest you’ll find. Curaçao eGaming Year established: 1996 Licensed operators: 450+ Curaçao eGaming is one of the longest-standing commissions. It has been around for over two decades. One of its goals is to prevent fraud, making it a reputable authority. Many of the best online casinos in the USA are licensed in Curaçao. Kahnawake Gaming Commission Year established: 1996 Licensed operators: 250+ Like Curaçao eGaming, the Kahnawake Gaming Commission (KGC) is an established regulator. It oversees gambling in the Kahnawake Mohawk Territory. It
