With all the choices out there, picking the best brakes can be tough, even for an experienced rider. In this article, we’ll take a look at some key factors that can help you make the right choice! What Is The Best Type of Brake For Motorcycles? When it comes to selecting the best brake for your motorcycle, you’ll need to consider a few major factors, including the specific motorcycle you’re buying for, your personal riding style, wet weather performance, and more. There are primarily two types of brakes used in motorcycles: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc Brakes: Disc brakes have gained immense popularity thanks to their superior stopping power and heat dissipation capabilities. They consist of a brake rotor attached to the wheel and a caliper that clamps down on the rotor when the brake lever is squeezed. The caliper houses brake pads, creating friction against the rotor and bringing the motorcycle to a stop. One of the key advantages of disc brakes is their ability to perform consistently, even in wet conditions. Additionally, disc brakes are less prone to fading, a phenomenon that can reduce braking efficiency due to excessive heat buildup during prolonged braking. Drum Brakes: Drum brakes, on the other hand, are an older technology that is still used in some motorcycles. They consist of a hollow drum attached to the wheel, with brake shoes inside the drum that push outward when the brake is applied. While drum brakes are less effective than disc brakes in terms of stopping power, they are often found on smaller, more economical motorcycles. Today, disc brakes have largely overtaken drum brakes in terms of performance. Their ability to provide consistent and powerful braking often makes them the preferred choice for motorcycle enthusiasts. No matter what kind of brakes you opt for, remember that there’s no replacement for regular, professional service and upkeep that treats your bike as well as you do! What Are Good Motorcycle Brake Brands? Choosing from a reliable brand is essential to the dependability of your bike’s braking system. While there’s a range of manufacturers producing top-of-the-line components, a few stand out from the crowd: Brembo: Brembo is synonymous with precision and performance in the world of brakes. Their products are widely used in motorsports and are often selected by manufacturers for use in high-performance models. Brembo brakes are known for their exceptional stopping power, durability, and advanced technology. EBC Brakes: Priding themselves on quality, EBC Brakes is another well-regarded brand in the motorcycle brake industry. They offer a wide range of brake pads and rotors designed to suit a true range of riding styles and conditions, producing components celebrated for their consistent performance and excellent brake feel. Galfer: A trailblazing manufacturer with sixty years in the game, Galfer specializes in crafting brake components that elevate riding experiences. With a focus on engineering and advanced materials, Galfer’s brake pads excel under demanding conditions, making them a preferred choice among track riders and sportbike enthusiasts. How Often To Replace Motorcycle Brakes? Like any part of your bike – from your wheels to your windscreen – your brakes require regular care. The frequency of brake replacement may depend on the type of riding you’re doing, the quality of your brake components, and your own personal maintenance practices. As a general rule of thumb, brake pads should be inspected regularly and replaced when they are worn down to a thickness of around 3mm. Ignoring worn brake pads can lead to decreased braking performance and potentially unsafe riding conditions. Brake rotors should also be inspected for signs of wear, warping, or scoring. If the rotor’s surface is uneven or damaged, it may lead to reduced braking efficiency. In some cases, rotors may need to be replaced along with brake pads to ensure optimal braking performance. Are ABS Brakes Necessary On A Motorcycle? ABS (Anti-Lock Braking System) helps prevent wheel lockup during hard braking, reducing the risk of skidding and maintaining steering control. While ABS was initially found primarily in cars, it’s become increasingly adopted in motorcycles as well, from the nimblest Suzuki to the most heavy-duty Harley Davidsons. ABS is especially beneficial for inexperienced riders or those faced with emergency braking situations. It can help prevent loss of traction and control (both common causes of accidents). It’s important to remember, however, that ABS isn’t a replacement for proper braking technique. For both seasoned riders and novices, ABS can provide an added layer of protection, especially in unpredictable riding conditions. In the exhilarating world of motorcycles, knowing how to pick the right brakes isn’t just important – it’s essential. Whether you’re riding a new or pre-owned bike, the right brakes and the right maintenance can help keep you safe and your bike performing at its absolute best!
