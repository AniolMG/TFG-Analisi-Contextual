In our experience in this business, both initially as customers and as "suppliers", which we are since 2006, we've had our fair share of unprofessionalism and ruthless personalities to deal with. From worn-out cars with their tachometers still requiring a first check, all the way to security deposits being completely withheld due to a little scratch on the bodywork. We at GTRENT have decided to stand up among the mass, not only in terms of being different, but also for being the best, and we go all out in order to impress you. In order to do this, we have built our business on some solid pillars and crucial principles, which we'll gladly describe you. Have you ever wondered why so many luxury car rental companies don't offer their address, just leaving mobile phone number for delivery instead? The reason is simple, it's because they don't have one! Our offices instead have a physical location, furniture and a secretary (it may seem obvious, but it's not ) . When they're not rented, our cars are either under maintenance at the workshop of the car dealer we bought them from, or in our garage! We will always be happy and proud to show you our fleet and offices whenever you want. > LARGE OWNED CARS FLEET > CARS WHIT SPECIAL INCURANCE FOR "RENTAL WITHOUT DRIVER" USE > CAR PHOTOS ARE REAL > FULL KASKO and RCA (TPL) INSURANCE ELEVATED AT 50,000,000 EURO > DELIVERY & COLLECTION IN ALL ITALY AND ALL EUROPE > 150 KM PER DAY ARE INCLUDED > 24/7 SUPPORT > NO HIDDEN COSTS, NO INTERMEDIARIES AND NO COMMISSION COSTS > SECURE PAYMENTS WITH CREDIT CARDS READ MORE WHERE WE ARE Via Persicetana Vecchia 28 40132 Bologna | Italy PHONE US +39 051 0216595 WRITE US info@gtrent.com WHATSAPP +39 051 0216595 ABOUT US Who we are Our team Why we are different LUXURY CAR HIRE Convertible Luxury SUV Sport Cars Comfort Cars SERVICES Home delivery Rental for weddings Life Style CUSTOMER SUPPORT Request to quote Info for the rental Why we are different TERMS AND CONDITIONS Contractual conditions Insurance Contacts SOCIAL © 2024 GTRent | WebDesign STUDIO Catuogno
