BIKES Cycle World Ten Best Bikes 2023 By Cycle World Staff WATCH: Our Ten Best of 2022 Over the past four decades, Cycle World has honored the Ten Best motorcycles each and every year. As times change, so do our categories. We’ve tried to keep up with the times by ensuring that the bike classes included in Ten Best accurately reflect what is happening in the current motorcycle market. Currently, we choose the best motorcycles in the Superbike, Standard, Open-Class Streetbike, Motocross, Cruiser, Middleweight Streetbike category and have recently added Adventure Bikes, Lightweight Streetbikes (500cc and under), combined Touring and Sport-Touring into a single class called Touring, and also melded Enduro and Dual-Sport to reflect a change in that market and a resurgence of street-legal, competition-worthy dual-purpose machines. Some of our categories have survived much longer than others, and only time will tell what tweaks we may need to make in the future. But with more than 450 different motorcycles currently available in the U.S. market, you can be assured that our Ten Best are the cream of a plentiful crop. After hours of testing, dyno runs, head-to-head comparisons, and a complete year with some of these bikes we have locked our selves in a room and decided on the best motorcycles of 2023.
