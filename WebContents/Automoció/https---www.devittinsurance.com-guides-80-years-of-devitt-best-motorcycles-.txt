Released in 1976 by BMW Motorrad after BMW teamed up with professional stylist Hans Muth to create something brand new. To this day the R100S remains one of the most practical long distance designed machines due to the wind tunnel designed frame that included the underpowered boxer engine and conservative chassis making a serious touring machine. “BMW R100RS. Effortless touring!” Jeffrey Holder BMW R100S credit BMBIKES 79. Kawasaki AR50 1981 until 1994 Kawasaki produced the 49cc, air-cooled two stroke AR50 moped. Despite the machine only being limited to 30mph learner laws, the AR50 had it all from good looks, affordable pricing and excellent handling. It may have only appealed to a limited few but it certainly spiced up the moped market. 78. Ducati 350 Desmo The Desmo created Ducati history in 1968 and that’s why you’ve voted in as one of the top 80 motorcycles ever. The first desmodromic production motorcycle ever created by Ducati whch produced just 22bhp meaning the machine was light and playful. Since then Ducati have produced a whole range of motorcycles, 250, 450 and off-roaders from the Desmo! Ducati 350 Desmo credit Topspeed 77. Ducati Pantah 500SL This 1979 model is argued to be the first ‘modern’ Ducati motorcycle ever, although it may be overshadowed by the 900SS and the 916 – the Pantah has a worthy place in our top 80 motorcycles! The machine was the first ever belt rather than bevel driven Duke which became the basis of the 951, 916 and many more models. 76. Harley-Davidson Low Rider The Low Rider FXS1200 was a big game changer for Harley, allowing the factory custom bikes to come out in full force; chopper bolt-ons, lowered rear-end and so much CHROME! This created a whole new direction for Harley and the custom gang. Today the Low Rider is a highly collectable item and very rarely will you see one up for auction. 75. BMW R69S A 1960 special by BMW, the classic boxer twin which a true motorcycling gem of today. BMW added a few luxurious touches to the R69S including Earls fork and a steering damper. If you want to get yourself BMW classic today then you’re looking at a hefty five figure sum, but the machines are in decent riding condition! BMW R69S credit bwmdean 74. Ducati 1098 Although the 1098 is long forgotten against the 916, it still remains one of the classic Ducati superbikes of all time. It takes on the stylings of the 916, but with a new ‘Evoluzione’ L-twin, Ducati were back in action. You can bag yourself a genuine Italian classic superbike for under £7,000. 73. Yamaha XT500 1976 saw the production of the XT500 marking its history as one of the original trail and endurance adventure motorcycles of today. Inspired BSA’s Scrambler machines in the 1960’s, the Yamaha XT rose to fame in the mid 70’s and saw a stream of imitation bikes follow in its wake. 72. Norton Commando Norton-Villiers manufactured the Commando via Norton Motorcycles from 1967 for 10 years and became a popular machine all over the world – notably it won Motorcycle News “Machine of the Year” award for five successive years (1968 – 1972)! Initially the machine was fitted with a 745cc displacement OHV pre-unit parallel-twin engine; however in 1973 the motorcycle was upgrade to an 850cc displacement. 71. Honda SP1/SP2 Built by Honda to prove a point that Honda could outsmart Ducati on the track using a V-Twin. The Honda SP1 and Honda SP2 are beautifully crafted machines with a wicked sound that makes you want to keep on riding forever. 70. Honda VRF 800 Also known as the ‘Interceptor’, the Honda 800 is a 782cc fuel injected sports touring machine that will give you plenty of power and fun! Since the initial release in 1998, the 800 has had its fair share of improvements including the dual combined braking system (DCBS) and VTEC valve-gear, which was used to combat noise and emission standards. 69. Aprilia Tuono One of the most popular naked styled machines created by Aprilia in 2002. The machine takes on a similar styling from the Aprilia RSV Millie sharing the same engine, frame and suspension system. “Best I’ve owned, probably my old Aprillia Tuono. Favourite dream bike? Probably a GSX1400.” Sam Duncombe 68. Yamaha SDR 200 Known as ‘The Whippet’ to most, the SDR 200 is a 200cc single-cylinder 2-stroke sport motorcycle. It was just intended to be for the Japanese market; however some Whippets were exported through 1986/7. 67. Triumph Tiger 900 Known as the ‘Steamer’ to most, the Tiger 900 debuted in 1993 and only saw minor improvements until the end of production in 1998. The 885cc, three cylinder engine dual sport motorcycle saw a small success in the UK, however became a big hit in US and Europe, namely Germany. The Steamer was heavily revised in 1999, seeing the creation of the T709 – a fuel injected version of the 885 cc engine. 66. BMW R1200GS The off-road orientated R1200gs is designed to be ridden across difficult terrain, proven by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman during their ‘Long Way Down’ trek across Europe and Africa. Powered by a partially liquid-cooled 1,1700cc boxer motor with an upgraded GS fuel tank holding 50% more than standard models, providing a decent 300 miles from the tank. BMW R1200GS 65. KTM 1190 A newer release from KTM, the 1190 Adventure R is whole package with chassis, electronic suspension and rider aids making the 230kf, 150bhp an extremely rider-friendly KTM Adventure. Bikes built by KTM are built to take on Darak so you’re promised rough, tough and reliability with your motorcycle. 64. Yamaha Thundercat The Thundercat is everything you could possible want in a sports-touring motorcycle, with a reliable engine, brilliant suspension and enough room to carry two weeks-worth of kit for your holidays! Clocking up top speeds of 145mph, you get plenty of bang for your buck with the Thundercat. 63. Honda Pan European Smooth, comfortable, powerful and fast, that’s everything you want in a bike, right?! Honda’s 2002 Pan European range is the perfect bike for a tourer to the daily commuter -no wonder that it’s made an appearance in our Best 80 Bikes. The Pan European works perfectly regardless if it’s 2 up or not, and you’re promised thousands of trouble-free miles on it. 62. Indian Scout Indian’s response to the Harley Davidson Sportster comes in the form of the very stylish Indian Scout. Full of style, authenticity, class and performance, the Scout won’t let you down. Another new bike on the block, only released in 2014, but the Scout is jam-packed with performance and handling that can be enjoyed by anyone. 61. BMW R1200RT BMW’s popular sport-touring model, R1200RT is one of the newer models released by the brand and despite a recall glitch in 2014, it still remains popular. Lightweight, sophisticated and extremely effective – what more could you want in a tourer? The secret to BMW success with the R1200RT is the partially water-cooling engine design which adds an extra bite to the bike. 60. Ducati Multistrada Ducati’s Multistrada series is the perfect embodiment of a touring motorcycle. The Multistrada range has been in creation since 2003 and as it’s essentially a hybrid of a supermoto and a sport-tourer motorcycle. The Multistrada 1000DS was the first bikes to be created of its type that featured a 992cc air-cooled V-twin engine, however updates have been made to the model to make it one of the best touring bikes for British roads. 59. Suzuki V Strom 650 Classed as a middleweight sport touring motorcycle by Suzuki, the V Strom 650 is fit for any purpose due to its adaptability of riding conditions including; commuting, cruising, adventure, touring, and even a degree of off-road riding too!

Honda Blackbird Honda’s Super Blackbird is one of the most comfortable, useable sports tourers available on the market- no surprise it made our shortlist! Production began in 1996 to challenge Kawasaki’s Ninja ZX-11 as the fastest production motorcycle and Honda successful achieved with a top speed of 178.5mph. “The Honda Blackbird, a worldwide selling superbike that was the benchmark for many, beautifully engineered and balance of performance, practicality and good looks.” Andy Bacon Honda Blackbird credit TopSpeed 56. Kawasaki W800 Kawasaki’s W800 sure does give Triumphs Bonneville a run for its money with its retro roadster feel, the old school up-right position isn’t the norm for Kawasaki but they’ve pulled it off. W800 is fitted with a 773cc fuel injected engine so you’ll still have the speed and the classic style. Kawasaki W800 credit Total Motorcycle 55. Triumph X75 Hurricane Destined to be the BSA Rocket3 but after BSA closing its factory doors in 1972, the bike was resurrected as the Triumph X75 Hurricane. A factory special model designed by fairing specialist Craig Vetter, it’s no wonder this beauty made the shortlist. The X75 had glass-fibre bodywork, a three US-gallon petrol tank, lowered gearing and a distinctive triple exhaust on the right-hand side. Triumph’s X75 is credited with creating a new class of motorcycle, the cruiser. Triumph X75 Hurricane 54. MV Agusta 600GT Only 172 machines were built of the 600GT in 1966 and remains one of the rarest and most desirable MV Agusta’s on the market. MV had been dominating the race scene for quite some time but stuck with the smaller capacity machines, however this was all set to change with the release of the 600GT but Count Domenico Agusta did not want to race any larger capacity machine in case it impacted the brand. Nicknamed ‘the Black Pig’ due to its distinctive looks, MV went above and beyond to make sure the machine was too ugly and far too heavy to race. 53. Kawasaki Versys The Versys range by Kawasaki is truly one of a kind with each model purpose built for all reasons – commuting to touring or just for the ride – the machines are truly versatile! Versys 650 is a popular model with some impressive specs including liquid-cooled engine, 4 stroke parallel-twin and plenty of power behind it. Kawasaki Versys credit Kawasaki 52.
