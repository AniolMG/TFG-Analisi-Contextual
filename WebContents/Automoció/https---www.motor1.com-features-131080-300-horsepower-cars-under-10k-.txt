NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES USA / GLOBAL Home Features Car Buying 300-Horsepower Cars You Can Snag For Under $10,000 Fast four doors from Ford, a few Chevy coupes, and even one supercharged Jag. Updated: Jul 10, 2023 at 3:10pm ET 0 By: Jeff Perez With used car prices still high, it's getting tougher to find affordable power. But deals are out there if you know where to look, and we'll help you find them with our latest list of 300-horsepower cars you can buy for under $10,000. The parameters for these selections are simple. We're looking to hit a $10,000 price point, although there are a few exceptions to the rule. And because people now keep their cars for nearly 12 years, we increased the age range to match, too. That puts our search somewhere in the area of 2012 vehicles, give or take a model year. We also put the mileage target between 85,000 to 100,000 miles to reflect the higher age of these vehicles. We then turned to the experts at Kelly Blue Book to determine the private party value of the vehicles identified. In addition to the above parameters, we also indicated the cars be rated "Good" for condition, and since KBB's tool forced us to choose a color, we picked the ever-popular Silver. So here we go. Get your checkbooks out for this year's list of cars with 300 horsepower for under $10,000. 2011 Chevrolet Camaro LS V6: $9,272 Engine 3.6-Liter V6 Horsepower 312 HP Transmission Six-Speed Automatic / Six-Speed Manual Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 6.0 Seconds You used to be able to buy a used Chevy Camaro with a V8 for under $10,000, but times have changed. Instead, we’re left with the V6 option in the 2011 Chevy Camaro LS. At least you’ll have bragging rights over Mustang owners because your 3.6-liter V6 makes 312 horsepower to the ‘Stang’s 305. 2011 Saab 9-5 Aero: $8,936 Engine Turbocharged 2.8-Liter V6 Horsepower 300 HP Transmission Six-Speed Automatic Drivetrain All-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 6.3 Seconds This model year was near the end of the line for Saab as a going concern, and the fact that the 9-5 at the time was an all-new design makes this car even more of a unicorn. If you can find the top-of-the-line Aero model, though, you’ll get a great-looking Swedish sedan with a unique turbocharged 2.8-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower. It even comes with all-wheel drive, making the 2011 9-5 a nice option for cold climates. Since Saab no longer exists, you may have trouble finding parts or service, but that’s a small price to pay for driving something truly unique. 2012 BMW 550i Sedan: $7,932 Engine Turbocharged 4.4-Liter V8 Horsepower 400 HP Transmission Eight-Speed Automatic Drivetrain All-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 4.3 Seconds The F10 BMW 5 Series dropped its predecessor's 4.8-liter V8 for a smaller but twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter engine, upping its output from 360 horsepower to a hearty 400 and improving its 60 time by half a second. The F10 generation also marked the arrival of a new eight-speed automatic transmission, electric power steering, and all-wheel drive. KBB estimates that one in good condition with 85,000 miles on the odometer will cost you $7,932, but if you’re willing to risk a car with over 100,000 miles, you might find one for even cheaper. 2012 Chrysler 300C: $9,105 Engine 5.7-Liter V8 Horsepower 363 HP Transmission Five-Speed Automatic Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 5.3 Seconds If you want a large rear-wheel-drive sedan, try the 2012 Chrysler 300C. It comes with the brand’s venerable 5.7-liter V8 engine producing 363 horsepower (a few more than the 550i). This model year was right after the 300’s major redesign and came with upgrades like a super large 8.4-inch infotainment screen with the brand’s much-loved Uconnect operating system. Despite this car being a decade old, its tech package at the time was advanced and has kept the car feeling modern even by today’s standards. 2012 Dodge Charger R/T: $9,934 Engine 5.7-Liter V8 Horsepower 370 HP Transmission Five-Speed Automatic Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 5.8 Seconds Dodge updated the Charger in 2011, marking the nameplate’s seventh generation. That change marked the arrival of newer and more powerful variants, like the R/T, which upped its output to 370 horsepower from its 5.7-liter Hemi V8. While still not nearly as affordable as its predecessor, you should be able to snag a seventh-gen Charger for under $10,000 if you know where to look. 2012 Ford Taurus SHO w/ Performance Package: $9,109 Engine Twin-Turbo 3.5-Liter V6 Horsepower 365 HP Transmission Six-Speed Automatic Drivetrain All-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 5.2 Seconds If you’re looking for pure performance, you may be surprised to find it in a Ford Taurus. The 2010 Ford Taurus SHO, however, was the rebirth of the marque’s famous Super High Output model from the late 1980s and 1990s, and you can get a 2012 model for under our price cap. Featuring a twin-turbocharged 3.5-Liter EcoBoost V6, it produced 365 horsepower. If you can find one with the Performance Package, get it. This option included a host of enhancements like better brakes, steering tweaks, a Sport Mode for the stability control, summer tires, and a spare tire delete to save a little bit of weight. Check Out These Expensive Alternatives: 50 Most Expensive Cars In The World 15 Best Selling Trucks Of 2022 2012 Hyundai Genesis 5.0: $9,731 Engine 5.0-Liter V8 Horsepower 429 HP Transmission Eight-Speed Automatic Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 4.9 Seconds The Hyundai Genesis launched in the 2009 model year, and by 2012 was being offered with a giant 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 429 horsepower. That’s 29 more horsepower than the original Dodge Viper, which you assuredly can’t buy for under 10 large. Hyundai also offered an R-Spec version of this model that added some go-fast hardware, but unfortunately, it doesn’t fall under our price target. So you’ll have to make do with this fine-handling, luxurious, high-tech, powerful luxury sedan as is. You’ll be OK, we promise. 2012 Infiniti G37 S Coupe: $10,071 Engine 3.7-Liter V6 Horsepower 330 HP Transmission Six-Speed Manual Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 5.4 Seconds Sure, you should be able to find a base Infiniti G37 coupe for well under $10,000. But if you want the sportier S model and are willing to risk it on a car with 100,000 miles, you’ll get a 330-hp version with bigger brakes, bigger wheels, a six-speed manual, and a sportier suspension setup. The 3.7-liter V6 gives it a 0-60 time of 5.5 seconds. Granted, the G37 S doesn’t exactly meet the criteria of "under $10,000," according to KBB, but what’s $71 between friends? 2012 Jaguar XF Supercharged: $8,623 Engine Supercharged 5.0-Liter V8 Horsepower 470 HP Transmission Six-Speed Automatic Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 4.9 Seconds Jaguar updated the look of its supercharged XF in 2011, but it still wins the award for being the most powerful car you can buy for under $10,000. Its breathing-assisted 5.0-liter V8 engine produces a staggering 470 horsepower. Sure, these weren’t the most reliable machines when new, but if you look for ones with a full history of recorded maintenance, you should be fine. The 2012 Jaguar XF Supercharged has made this list every year we’ve done it, and may never be toppled as the King of Cheap Horsepower. 2013 BMW 335i Coupe: $9,290 Engine Turbocharged 3.0-Liter I6 Horsepower 300 HP Transmission Six-Speed Manual Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 5.1 Seconds A year before BMW killed off the 3 Series coupe and turned it into the 4 Series, the 335i was a reasonably fun luxury performance car that packed a 300-horsepower 3.0-liter inline-six engine, a six-speed manual, and rear-wheel drive. Find one with just over 85,000 miles and KBB estimates that you should be able to take it home for under $10,000. 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8: $9,369 Engine 3.8-Liter V6 Horsepower 333 HP Transmission Six-Speed Manual Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 5.5 Seconds Not only did the Genesis Coupe get a new look for 2013 that included an updated interior, but Hyundai added more oomph to the 3.8-liter model giving it 333 horsepower. With that punchier V6 and rear-wheel drive, the Genesis Coupe 3.8 could scoot to 60 in just 5.5 seconds. Find one in good condition with 85,000 on the odometer, and KBB says you should be able to take it home for less than $10,000. 2014 Cadillac CTS Coupe: $9,034 Engine 3.6-Liter V6 Horsepower 318 HP Transmission Six-Speed Automatic Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 6.0 Seconds Even though Cadillac updated the CTS sedan for the 2014 model year, the coupe soldiered on into the new year with minimal changes. It still packed a 3.6-liter V6 engine with 318 horsepower and a six-speed automatic transmission with rear-wheel drive. You should be able to find a few well-kept examples for under the $10,000 mark. 2015 Ford Mustang V6: $10,938 Engine 3.7-Liter V6 Horsepower 300 HP Transmission Six-Speed Manual Drivetrain Rear-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH 5.5 Seconds We’re stretching the definition (again) of "under $10,000," but only by a few hundred bucks. If you find one with 100,000 miles on the odometer, KBB says you should be able to take home a 2015 Mustang V6 for under $11,000. Prices are destined to drop further with the arrival of the new 2024 model. At that price, you get a 3.7-liter V6 engine good for 300 horsepower, paired to either a six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed automatic. That will get you to 60 miles per hour in 5.5 seconds. FAQs Is 300 horsepower a lot for a car? It depends on some factors, like the size and weight of the car as well as what that engine was designed to do (go fast or pull hard). In general, though, yes, 300 horsepower is a lot. This data from 2020 shows the average horsepower of a new car then was 247. That figure has usually gone up over time, but is still far from the magical 300 number. How fast can a 300-horsepower car go? The answer is dependent on a number of factors like the size and weight of the car, its tires, the type of engine, the purpose of the vehicle, and many more. For instance, the 2011 BMW 335i sport sedan on our list has a 300-horsepower twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine and can go 0-60 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds, which is quick. However, the 2009 Land Rover Range Rover Sport on our list, which also has 300 horsepower, goes 0-60 mph in a much slower 8.2 seconds because it’s heavier, less aerodynamic, and its engine isn’t tuned just for maximum acceleration. What cars have 300 horsepower? Almost any car could have 300 horsepower, but we generally see this power figure in vehicles like luxury sedans, large SUVs, and muscle cars. Nearly every vehicle on our list falls into one of those three categories. Trucks are also usually available with engines that produce over 300 horsepower, but they’re less fun to drive. What cheap cars have 300 horsepower? The cheapest car on our list is the 2009 Buick LaCrosse Super Sedan at $6,075, while its twin, the 2009 Chevy Impala SS goes for $6,091. That said, the more miles a used car has, the cheaper it will be to buy. The prices on this list were all based on mileage of 100,000 miles, so if you found one of these cars for sale with 150,000 miles, it should be less expensive to buy than our list says. That said, it may be less reliable and require more maintenance. Is 400 horsepower a lot for a car? Yes, 400 horsepower is a lot for any type of car. Back in the early 1990s, 400 horsepower was reserved for the most powerful sports cars around. But today, you can get 400 horsepower in many types of used vehicles, from luxury sedans to SUVs to affordable sports cars. JOIN THE CONVERSATION 0 Got a tip for us?
