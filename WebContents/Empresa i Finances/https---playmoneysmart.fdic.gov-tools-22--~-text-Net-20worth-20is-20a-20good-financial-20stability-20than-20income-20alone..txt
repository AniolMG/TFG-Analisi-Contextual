Your net worth is your assets minus your liabilities. It’s what you have left over after you pay all your liabilities. Net worth is a better measure of someone’s financial stability than income alone. A person’s income could be disrupted by job loss or reduction in work hours. Income doesn’t indicate how much debt someone has or how much savings or other assets they have. Your net worth can be a positive number, zero, or a negative number. A positive net worth means the value of your assets covers all your liabilities, and there is still some left over. This means you have a cushion for financial emergencies. It’s good to have a positive net worth. Zero net worth means your assets equal your liabilities. You don’t have a financial cushion. A negative net worth means your liabilities are greater than your assets. You don’t have a financial cushion in this situation either. There are three steps to calculating net worth: Step 1: List your financial and physical assets and their values. Your total assets will be calculated automatically. We do not include the value of intangible productive assets (such as a college degree) when calculating net worth. Step 2: List your liabilities and the amounts owed on them. Your total liabilities will be calculated automatically. Step 3: Review the table, “My Net Worth.” Your total assets minus total liabilities will be calculated automatically.
