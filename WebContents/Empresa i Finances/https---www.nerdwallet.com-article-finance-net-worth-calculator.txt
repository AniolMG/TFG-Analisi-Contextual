CHAT WITH AN ADVISOR NerdWallet Advisory LLC What is my net worth? To calculate your net worth, take inventory of what you own, as well as your outstanding debt. And when we say own, we include assets that you may still be paying for, such as a car or a house. For example, if you have a mortgage on a house with a market value of $200,000 and the balance on your loan is $150,000, you can add $50,000 to your net worth. Basically, the formula is: ASSETS minus LIABILITIES equals NET WORTH And by the way, your income is not included in a net worth calculation. A person can bring home a big paycheck but have a low net worth if they spend most of their money. On the other hand, even people with modest incomes can accumulate significant wealth and a high net worth if they buy appreciating assets and are prudent savers. » RELATED: Liquid net worth: A formula to stop living paycheck to paycheck Calculating net worth: What are assets and liabilities? If you’re not sure what assets and liabilities are, here are some guidelines: Assets: Assets include cash — such as in your checking, savings and retirement accounts — and certain investments, such as stocks and bonds, that you could sell for cash. These are often referred to as liquid assets. Some fixed assets can count toward your net worth calculation, too, provided you can or would sell them if needed. For example, your home would count toward your net worth if you’re willing to use it for a home equity line of credit or sell it should the need arise. Liabilities: Any money you owe to another person or entity falls under this category. That includes revolving consumer debts — such as credit card balances — as well as personal, auto, payday and title loan balances. If you’re using your home as an asset, its mortgage counts as a liability as well. Do you include a 401(k) in a net worth calculation? All of your retirement accounts are included as assets in your net worth calculation. That includes 401(k)s, IRAs and taxable savings accounts. Want us to do it for you?
