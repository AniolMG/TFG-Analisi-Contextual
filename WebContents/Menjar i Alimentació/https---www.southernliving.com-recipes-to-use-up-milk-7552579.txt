By Jenna Sims Published on July 9, 2023 PHOTO: GREG DUPREE; FOOD STYLIST: ALI RAMEY; PROP STYLIST: HANNAH GREENWOOD For most Southerners, milk is a staple you'll always find in their refrigerator. Whether you've ended up with one too many gallons or your milk is about to expire, these recipes with milk will help you make use of what you have on hand. Not only is milk used in many breakfast recipes, it's also used in a variety of dinner recipes, side dishes, and of course, desserts. From French Toast to Meatloaf to Mashed Potatoes and more, here are our best recipes to use up milk. 01 of 25 French Toast JESSICA FURNISS We used white bread for this classic French Toast recipe, but you can use the bread of your choice. This recipe makes 2 servings, but can easily be doubled (or tripled!). 02 of 25 Edible Cookie Dough CAITLIN BENSEL; FOOD STYLIST: TORIE COX If you're craving a sweet treat, this edible cookie dough comes together in just 15 minutes and doesn't require you to turn on the oven. Plus, it comes together with a handful of pantry staples you probably already have on hand. 03 of 25 Old-Fashioned Banana Pudding PHOTO: CAITLIN BENSEL; FOOD STYLIST: TORIE COX Though it may be hard to resist, we recommend letting banana pudding cool a bit before serving so it will thicken up. 04 of 25 Joanna Gaines' Mashed Potatoes AMY NEUNSINGER/MAGNOLIA TABLE BY JOANNA GAINES From Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines, this traditional mashed potatoes recipe calls for just potatoes, milk, butter, salt, and pepper. It can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. 05 of 25 Strawberry Cream Cheese Cobbler GREG DUPREE; FOOD STYLIST: RUTH BLACKBURN This strawberry cobbler comes together with just 15 minutes of hands-on time.

The milk mixture is poured over the baked cake and absorbed as it chills in the refrigerator overnight. 18 of 25 Sweet- and - Spicy Corn Soup VICTOR PROTASIO; FOOD STYLING: RISHON HANNERS; PROP STYLING: AUDREY DAVIS The best thing about this corn soup is that it comes together in just 30 minutes.
