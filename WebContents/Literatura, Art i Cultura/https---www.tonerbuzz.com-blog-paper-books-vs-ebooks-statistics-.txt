This made sense. There were no printing, paper, or shipping costs involved, so a digital book should naturally cost less. A decade ago, it was not uncommon to see a hardcover bestseller priced at $25 with a digital edition price around half that. Today the prices of physical books are much closer, especially when it comes to new releases and popular authors. The cost of the latest Susanne Collins or Stephen King book will be nearly the same in both hardcover and e-book editions. The real savings of eBooks come with older works and backlist titles. The digital editions of books that have been available for a while drop significantly. You can get eBook editions of classic literature for very cheap (even free). Independent authors also offer up a wide variety of eBooks that are priced less than books from traditional publishers. There are bargain books in both the physical and digital realms. You can find plenty of one-dollar eBooks online, enough to max out your e-reader. You can also find a table filled with $5 hardcovers at the local warehouse store. Overall, eBooks will save avid readers money, but not as much you’d expect.
