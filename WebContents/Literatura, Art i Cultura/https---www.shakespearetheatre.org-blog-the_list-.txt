What’s On Learn Give Now Account 100 (mostly obscure) plays you have to see before you die. THE DREW LICHTENBERG BUCKET LIST 100 (MOSTLY OBSCURE) PLAYS YOU HAVE TO SEE BEFORE YOU DIE Ground rules: * can’t be a play that STC has produced previously * no more than one play per author (except for my favorites) * no musicals! * no 21st-century plays; it’s just too soon to tell When you are a literary manager, you read a lot of plays that have been consigned to the dustbin of history. One of the ways of keeping track of all of them is to make lists—bucket lists, perhaps—of works that you love but the theatre hasn’t yet produced. One of the great thrills for the dramaturg is seeing a play jump off their own personal list and into production. (Usually goosed by a little help along the way—we dramaturgs are tiny, but we are scrappy and have been known to obsessively suggest the same titles to artistic directors for years and years.) It’s not always smooth: sometimes a reading can kill a play dead, sometimes a bad translation or adaptation can stop it even sooner. But part of the excitement of being a dramaturg lies in the fact that we are tasked on some level to be dreamers, to keep an ever-evolving wish-list in our heads. It all sounds very utopian, but putting this list together was agonizing, as is anything regarding the canon. It is not meant to be a definitive account of the best plays ever written. I have intentionally left off plays which will be familiar in favor of ones that have been marginalized for reasons irrespective of their quality. Most obviously, because of longstanding cultural and evidentiary prejudices, there is a striking lack of women and artists of color until the 20th century (really, until the second half of the 20th century). Representation is an ever-evolving conversation, and it inevitably leads to larger questions about aesthetics, form, and the stories that we tell. Having said that, I’d prefer to let the list speak for itself. It’s organized thematically-chronologically, if that makes sense, with short accompanying title-headers.—DL Political Drama (The Family) 1. Aeschylus, The Oresteia (458 BCE) 2.
