By Alison Fox Published on March 6, 2024 PHOTO: WALTER BIBIKOW/GETTY IMAGES The most luxurious airport in the world is located in a city intent on building the biggest and best of everything: Dubai. Dubai International Airport (DXB) was recently named the most opulent, according to a study from AllClear Travel Insurance. The airport in the United Arab Emirates, which is focused on making the airport an experience in itself, took the top spot mostly due to the more than 70 luxury hotels within a three-mile radius of the terminal. “Dubai as a destination is well known across the world for luxury and wealth, so it’s not too surprising that the airport ranks as the most luxurious on the globe,” the study wrote about its decision. “The airport is the fastest-growing aviation hub in the world, and it even has its own 5-star hotel located inside the airport itself. With zen gardens, an outdoor swimming pool, a gym, cinemas, and a bounty of restaurants – this is one airport that will certainly leave you feeling refreshed ahead of jumping on your flight.” The study examined more than 1,800 airports and looked at which terminals offered at least 10 lounges, surveyed the number of designer shops available, noted the number of luxury hotels in the area, and checked whether travelers could find perks like Champagne or caviar before boarding. London’s Heathrow Airport (LHR) came in at No. 2 on the list thanks to its impressive number of lounges and amount of luxury shops. Qatar’s Hamad International Airport (DOH) in Doha, which added an exclusive new Louis Vuitton restaurant and lounge last year, took the third spot on the list. France's Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) and Australia's Sydney Airport (SYD) rounded out the top 5. New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) was the highest-ranked airport in the United States and came in at No. 11 on the list. That was followed by Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) at No. 16 — it was the only other U.S. airport to make the top 20. Was this page helpful?
