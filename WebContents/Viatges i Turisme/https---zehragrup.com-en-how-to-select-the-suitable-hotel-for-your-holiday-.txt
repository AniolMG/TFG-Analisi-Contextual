This way, if we proceed step by step, we can have a more efficient holiday. Is it summer with sea, sand, and sun or winter with thermal springs or ski centers? Our economic budget is very important in this regard because it is more expensive in summer months. If we look at the day and weather conditions, there are many places where we can go out and have fun and spend money. We can join nature walks, which will be more affordable. Or, if a hotel with all-inclusive or even breakfast included is expensive, we can eat within our own budget by renting an apartment. For vacation plans, the best prices, easy payment options, discounts, and promotions are offered. Therefore, you can look at all hotels that make holiday plans throughout the year, especially early reservations. With the same budget, you can have longer holidays and unforgettable holiday memories. Regions where winter or summer holidays are made are suitable in summer and winter, respectively. These reasons are that there is no peak season, for example, June, July, August are the highest and most expensive summer season, and December, January, and February are the highest and most expensive winter season. You can take advantage of budget-friendly holiday opportunities that are suitable for the season in other months except for these months. If you have no information about the region you are going to and the hotels in that region, there are a few tips to choose the right hotel where you will spend your entire holiday. The internet is the easiest and shortest way to choose the most suitable hotel for you in the place you will travel. You can examine all the experiences of the users who stayed and commented on the hotels in the region you will go to from various holiday and travel review sites such as TripAdvisor.com. While examining the ratings and comments, there are options that group them according to whether the guests are young, couples (honeymoon), families with children or on a business trip. If you choose the closest group to you, you can come to a more precise conclusion because every vacationer’s expectation from the hotel is different. While some people want entertainment, others prefer a quiet and relaxing hotel to clear their minds. First of all, create a list of hotels you like based on ratings and hotel reviews from social media research without looking at the prices. Add the prices you found on different sites within this list in the order of your preferred hotels and compare them. Keep in mind that hotel prices change every 2 to 3 weeks depending on promotions. To get the correct prices, the number of people, if there are children and their ages, birth year, check-in and check-out dates, and room types should be the same on all search sites. Each hotel has its own official website. You can also compare prices by looking at the prices on their own pages. If you want to go back to a hotel you have visited before, you can contact the hotel and find out if there are any special promotional prices or discounts for “repeat guests”. When creating a hotel list for your family, it’s important to also find out details such as whether the hotel only accepts adults, allows pets or not, and the age range for free children. Knowing these details can protect you from any last-minute unpleasant surprises. It’s also helpful to check out tour operators or agencies. Agencies that work with many hotels throughout the season may have better information and access to better prices and services. You can find various hotel options from travel agencies or the hotel’s direct call center number. You can get information about prices and hotel details of the hotels on your own hotel list by visiting agency websites, agency offices, or calling by phone. In any case, no one can predict the best choice for you better than you, because you know what you want better than anyone else. Your friends or salespeople may suggest hotels for you and your family, but listen to them without letting them play a big role in your decision. Because service is a concept that is produced and consumed at the same time, experiencing a good or bad experience does not guarantee that you will experience the same. We should also be very careful when choosing a honeymoon hotel. Are we going to the place to see and visit, or are we going to take advantage of the facilities the hotel will offer us to relax? We want our honeymoon vacation to be special for us. Considering the room decoration, meals, region, hotel decoration, hotel animation, and the service it provides, it should be a complete whole. Convenience is important, and hotel features are also important. The most beautiful honeymoon hotels usually show themselves in the summer. Hotels with their greenery and nature reveal themselves both visually and in terms of presentation. We can choose a region that we have never seen before or that we have never dreamed of. This way, we can make our vacation more exciting. We should examine the hotel’s features carefully. If we are a honeymoon couple, we should check if there are any special amenities for us, and if we have children, are there any kids’ clubs available? Is there any entertainment? If we are adults without kids, we should look for places to spend our time, or if we have a middle-aged child, how can we have fun together? Nobody wants to have an unhappy vacation. Therefore, our choices should be accurate and appropriate. Also, what one person doesn’t enjoy or leave happily on a vacation, may be enjoyable for us. Everyone’s thoughts are different, and that is also an important factor. When choosing a hotel that suits our vacation, if your idea of a vacation is to explore and not to stay in the hotel, it is beneficial to choose hotels or guesthouses that offer bed and breakfast services. This system, which is cheaper than all-inclusive hotels, only offers breakfast. All other meals are up to you. If you want to explore new places and discover new flavors during the day, you can consider this option. In this case, the bed and breakfast system will be the most suitable for you. It is the most economical vacation program for those who do not want to be tied to anywhere and want to do everything themselves. For adventure enthusiasts, the only important factor in hotel selection is the proximity to the activity area. Participation in activities can only be once or twice a day. As it can be exhausting, it may not be possible to spend the whole day with water sports activities. For this reason, holidaymakers who want to spend their holidays both in the hotel and experience adrenaline prefer hotels. In the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts, there are generally adventure enthusiasts who want to participate in parasailing activities. Similarly, holidaymakers who spend their day in the hotel and leave the hotel to participate in activities complete their evenings and other vacation days in the hotel. It is the goal of hotels to provide many benefits such as cleanliness, food and beverage options, and entertainment, as well as Olympic-sized pools and water parks to ensure the comfort of all vacationers, regardless of age. For those who have worked hard all year and want to spend their holiday relaxing, hotels are the ideal destination. In this article, we have tried to answer questions such as how to choose a hotel when going on holiday or traveling, and what to pay attention to when choosing a hotel. We hope that our article on choosing the right hotel and holiday has been helpful to you.
