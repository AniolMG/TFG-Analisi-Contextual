A game based solely on farming? How did this one possibly get off the drawing board? Over half a dozen sequels later, Harvest Moon has made me feel quite foolish. It did what would seem to be the impossible –- it made a repetitive, seemingly boring concept into something fun and enjoyable. As with most RPGs, the enjoyment comes from the continual progress: creating something from nothing, earning rewards for your hard work, and finding new and effective ways to do the same old tasks. Yet despite its relatively simple objectives, the information available about Harvest Moon remains some of the most inaccurate and incomplete I have ever read. To make matters worse, people have conflated subsequent games in the series with this one, resulting in numerous bad strategies and erroneous tactics. That is why this guide was created. Whether you are a novice looking for the most effective way possible to approach a task each day or an expert seeking the perfect score, this guide should help you. And most of all, it should finally put an end to many of the egregious errors and time wasting tips that have plagued gamers for years. ============================================================================== D I S C L A I M E R HM01 ============================================================================== This FAQ is meant for personal use only and cannot be reproduced for commercial use under any circumstances.

This will hopefully save you time and prevent you from reading any unnecessary spoilers. The four sections are explained below. 1. OVERVIEW: This section contains the basics of gameplay, farming, tools, livestock, events, and other fundamentals. Some parts of this section are rudimentary and are intended for players who are new to the game. Others, such as the ones on farming, livestock, and relationships, are much more in-depth and will be useful to veterans and first timers alike. In general, this section contains few to no spoilers, and even potential spoilers are noted in advance. 2. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: The answers to some of the more common stumbling points are contained here. This section is divided by functional area of the game and is intended to address specific questions without spoiling other parts of the game. If you are stuck on something, see if your question is answered here first. 3. WALKTHROUGH: As its name implies, this is a detailed walkthrough of the game. Since Harvest Moon is a non-linear, open-ended experience, this section shows just one possible method of playing. However, the walkthrough will give instructions on how to do everything as soon as possible, assuming your intentions are to achieve a perfect score and complete any goal in the most effective way. The walkthrough does contain some spoilers as they occur, so please keep this in mind before reading. 4. APPENDIX: This is a reference section that contains information on special items and upgrades, detailed farming and relationship statistics, information on getting a perfect ending and scores, interesting secrets, and more. The appendix is largely a reference source containing numerical and statistical information about the game. This section does contain spoilers, so please be warned in advance. ______________________________________________________________________________ O V E R V I E W ______________________________________________________________________________ The following section gives overview information on all areas of the game and should give a solid framework for anyone playing this game. While some sections are fairly basic, the later sections on farming, livestock, and relationships are highly detailed and useful for both veterans and new players. ============================================================================== 1. S T O R Y HM11 ============================================================================== You are Jack, a young man whose parents have just given him a ranch. Jack's parents are going away for two and half years, and during that time they have entrusted Jack to fix up the old ranch and begin a productive, adult life. Jack's parents expect him to engage in farming, raising livestock, maintaining and improving the ranch, getting married, and starting a family. Despite Jack's parents' expectations, there are numerous styles of play in this game. You can attempt to become a millionaire, amassing as much money as possible. You can play as a serial bachelor, spending all day talking to women and all night at the bar. You can become a rugged outdoorsman, choosing to spend your days fishing and hanging out at the mountain. You can settle down as a family man and have two children, forsaking any farm work to spend time with them. Or, you can do a bit of all these things. The choice is entirely yours. ============================================================================= 2. S C O R I N G HM12 ============================================================================= The game ends after two and a half years when Jack's parents return (after the third summer), and you will be scored on the life you led during the time they were away. The game scores you in three different ways. The first is on how much of the ranch is covered and developed. This is called the Development Rate. The second is on Jack's happiness, which is a measure of how "satisfying" his life is. This is referred to as the Happiness score. The third is on how well Jack manages the ranch and all other aspects of farm life. This is referred to as the Ranch Master score. These scores are loosely independent. For example, it possible to receive a high Happiness score but low Ranch Master score, and vice versa. In general, the game encourages you to balance as many activities as you can for the best score. In addition to these scores, there are numerous endings to this game, each dependent on how you played during your time on the ranch. The exact scoring calculations can be found in the appendix, but you will need to excel at all the following categories to receive the best ending and score. GENERAL GOALS ============= - Save a lot of money - Get married - Have children - Upgrade your house - Grow and sell all four types of crops - Raise as many cows and chickens as possible - Brush and talk to all cows to increase their affection - Develop as much of the farm as possible (with fence, crops, or grass) - Develop strong relationships with the five single girls in town ============================================================================= 3. C O N T R O L S HM13 ============================================================================= The controls for Harvest Moon are simple and intuitive. You control your character from an overhead point of view and the controls do not change at any point in the game. DIRECTIONAL PAD (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) - Moves Jack vertically and horizontally in the direction pressed. Y-BUTTON - Uses the tool in the active hand. - At the pond on the mountain, use the Y button to cast the fishing rod into the water. X-BUTTON - Toggles between the two tools you are carrying. B-BUTTON - Cancels a selection or closes a screen. - Used to sprint. You will sprint in the direction you are facing so long as the button is held. - Used to jump over the fence on your ranch and off cliffs at the mountain. A-BUTTON - This is the main action button. It is used to speak with people, pick up items, examine objects, or interact with anything else. - Selects a command on a menu screen. R-BUTTON - Causes Jack to whistle and summon his horse. It is most effectively used when standing in a straight line facing the horse. L-BUTTON - Causes Jack to whistle and summon his dog. This is the easiest way to move the dog. It is most effectively used when standing in a straight line facing the dog. START - This exits the demo and takes you to the title screen. It is not used during the game otherwise. SELECT (Z-button if using a Gamecube controller on the Virtual Console) - This brings up the menu screen, which displays the date, money, and shows the item in Jack's active hand. This effectively pauses the game. It can not be used while holding an item. ============================================================================== 4. L O C A T I O N S HM14 ============================================================================== There are three main locations where most of this game takes place: the Ranch, the Town, and the Mountain. Below are maps and descriptions of each area, along with several other key areas on your ranch. ===== RANCH ===== The ranch is where you will spend most of your time. The primary activities include farming and maintaining livestock. Note that this is just the fenced off area of the ranch. The ranch extends beyond this map and contains several other structures (trees and well) that are important later on in the game. o-----------------------------------------------------------------------o | RANCH MAP | o-----------------------------------------------------------------------o | | | | | ################################# | | # ================---- ############################### | | # = =||||| ============ # | | # = ________ =____| ======== ____ ========= # | | # =/--------\ = E _______ / \ ________ # | | # =| D _ | = __ /-------\( )/--------\ # | | # |____|_|_| = |__|| G ||\____/|| I | # | | # . ===== |--|| _ || || _ | # | | # .
