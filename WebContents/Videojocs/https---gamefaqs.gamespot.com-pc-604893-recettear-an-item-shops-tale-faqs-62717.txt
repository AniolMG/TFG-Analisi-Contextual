While most of us have someone else to count on, poor Recette has to deal with the enourmous debt herself. Can Recette and her new fairy accountant Tear, who is totally not her sister, deal with this avalanche of Pix? Only you can decide how to run your item shop and where this tale's future will end up. Hopefully... it's not a cardboard box. Are you ready? Then say it with me...

It seems that several others have tried, but they just lost interest/didn't have time to finish one. Seeing as how I loved this game to pieces and I'm a somewhat experienced FAQ creator, I decided to make one. In this update: -Basic skeleton made -Basic control scheme done -Basic rundown of characters done -Hall of Trials done -Jade Way done -Amber Garden done -Some basic info for Obsidian Tower and Crystal Nightmare -Arranging Your Shop section basics and tips done -Detailed explanation on Atmosphere done -Contact Information set -Legal junk set First attempt at submittion now. Let's pray for the best. V. 1.1: July 24-25, 2011 Yayifications! The FAQ was accepted on try one! Time to continue putting meat on this bad boy's bones. I've already thought of some upgrades I can make to content that I've already put down, like a better chart to show the preferred atmosphere of the customers. That's for after this guide is complete, though. You can't ice the cake without baking it first, right? Now let's get baking. In this update: -Obsidian Tower done -Crystal Nightmare done -Fusion Rank 1 items done -Credits set The walkthrough itself should be finished by the next version, so stay tuned for that. I can't guide you step-by-step due to the several varying factors in this game. However, I CAN help you earn more money to erase that debt easily. Also, I'm changing around the game's definition a bit for this. Since I can't exactly guide you to the end of the debt, I'll guide you to the end of the game's story. V. 1.2: April 7-8, 2013 I'm back to give this poor, abandoned guide one last touch-up before finally sending it on its way. After 2 Years, there isn't much else I plan to add. However, finishing what I left open way back when is a top priority. Consider this update a warm-up for the upcoming gameplay/walkthrough update in V. 1.3. In this update: -Fusion Rank 2 items done -Fusion Rank 3 items done -Fusion Rank 4 items done -Fusion Rank 5 items done -Controls revamped to be significantly more detailed -Added Skills section for each of the Adventurers -Made the Table of Contents more detailed -Minor formating corrections spread out around the guide ++++++++++++ ++++++++++++ ++CONTROLS++ ++++++++++++ ++++++++++++ *~In Store~* Z: Interact with Object/Talk to Tear X: N/A C: N/A V: Change camera W: Open Main Menu ESC: Open Main Menu *~While selling/buying~* Z: Select X: Back C: Item Details Up Arrow: Increase Price Down Arrow: Decrease Price *~In Dungeon~* Z: Basic Attack X: Use selected Special Attack C: Change Special Attack W: Open Main Menu ESC: Open Main Menu Arrow Keys: Movement ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++ADVENTURERS AND OTHER CHARACTERS++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ This following section is a compendium of all the characters in the game. Well... characters that aren't enemies, I mean. Wait.. characters that were enemies but now aren't... Yeah. Those too. The form is as follows: Status: What kind of character this character is How to Recruit: How to recruit said character Shopping Times: The times when this character will enter your shop Preferred Atmosphere: The preferred shopping atmosphere* Likes: What this character is likely to buy Budget: How much money this character has Equips: What this character equips Notes: Personal notes from me and extras * For more info about atmosphere, please see section 4.1 +++++++++ +Recette+ +++++++++ Recette is the heart and soul of this game. With an everlasting smile and an endless sweet tooth, no wonder she's loved by the community. She's one of two main characters, but the only one you get to control. Status: Main Character How to Recruit: Available in the beginning Shopping Times: N/A Preferred Atmosphere: N/A Likes: Candy Budget: N/A Equips: N/A Notes: Recette doesn't battle, so she requires no equipment. ++++++ +Tear+ ++++++ Tear is an agent from the bank to collect the debt Recette has to handle. She makes Recette's life easier by having the debt payed in snowballing installments. She claims to not have any emotional ties to Recette, but you'll see how that goes. In the end, this fairy will be your ally to the end. She's the second main character, but isn't able to be controlled. Status: Main Character How to Recruit: Available in the beginning Shopping Times: N/A Preferred Atmosphere: N/A Likes: N/A Budget: N/A Equips: N/A Notes: Tear doesn't battle, so she requires no equipment. When you're in your shop, Tear randomly flies around the shop and brushes your items. Just in case you haven't caught on, she's a fairy. ++++++ +Arma+ ++++++ The first time you see Arma, you assume.... nothing, really. She's just sorta standing and looking through your shop's window. Once you start talking to her, things just get even more confusing. How does she not know about PIX? It makes the world go round! She sure is a strange one. Who knows what mysteries surround her... Status: Adventurer How to Recruit: Finish the game in continue in Endless Mode All adventurers must be unlocked via Business/True cards Defeat the Geddon Device in the Lapis Ruins (100th floor) Arma will visit Recettear to give you her Business Card Shopping Times: Morning, Noon, Evening, Night Preferred Atmosphere: 0 Light/Dark 0 Plain/Gaudy Likes: Arm Parts Books Ingredients Medicines Budget: Min 2000 Max 5,000,000 Equips: Arm Parts Clothes Breastplates Armor Hats Helms Charms Necklaces Rings Notes: Her attack skills vary, depending on what Arm Part she has equipped. She can't dash. =Skills= [Vector Cannon] --------------- A mysterious, hard to control super-weapon built into Arma. What's its purpose? Cost: Maximum SP After a long charge-up time, a massive beam of power will explode forward and annihiliate virtually every enemy unfortunate to be in the way. The only enemies able to stand after withstanding such an attack are knights due to their shield ability and the stronger bosses. Weaker bosses will be taken out of commission. +++++++++ +Caillou+ +++++++++ No, he's not a bald little kid with a yellow shirt. He is still a kid, though. Caillou is a smart child for his age. However, he's not smart enough to figure that our candy-loving girl Recette is the owner of the store. He simply refuses to believe it, actually. At least he's a powerful battle mage. Status: Adventurer How to Recruit: Beat Jade Way Reach Merchant Level 7 Fulfill Caillou's request Gain trust with him by giving him good deals Accept his Business Card once he offers it Shopping Times: Morning, Noon, Evening Night Preferred Atmosphere: 6 Dark 6 Plain Likes: Books Charms Ingredients Medicine Rings Robes Staves Budget: Min 3000 Max 1,000,000 Equips: Staves Clothes Robes Bracelets Hats Charms Capes Scarves Shoes Rings Notes: He runs slower than most other adventurers Personally? I don't like him. =Skills= [Pyrobomb] ---------- Create an explosion centered on Caillou. Cost: 5 SP Think of Pyrobomb as Caillou's method of getting some breathing space. If enemies are starting to surround you, pop it and get out as soon as you can. You CAN run up to enemies and use it, but I advise against it. [Ice Mine] ---------- Create a block of ice. Enemies that touch it take damage. Cost: 5 SP Ice Mine is better used as part of a defensive strategy. Simply lay one down behind you while enemies are chasing you and watch the fun. [Sparkburst] ------------ Fires off a torrent of arcane missiles, penetrating any darkness. Cost: 5 SP on initial trigger, but can spend more to continue skill by holding X Caillou holds his ground and fires off several projectiles in a cone-shaped area in front of him. You can continue the attack by holding X if you need more power. Even though Caillou can't move while this attack is being used, you're still able to change the direction he's facing. [Gemini Force] -------------- A pair of magic shields which orbit Caillou. Send flying with the attack button! How to Learn: Reach Level 25 Cost: 25 SP Two orbs and a few more appear around Caillou. They protect him from enemies that get too close. If you press the attack button, the orbs will fly out and home in on any nearby enemies. If there is no enemy close enough, the orbs will just continue to float. [Warp] ------ Warp Caillou to another area on the dungeon floor How to Learn: Reach Level 30 Cost: 5 SP It's the same as triggering one of the warp trap chests. Caillou is transported to a different part of the dungeon floor. Nothing much to it. It's the ultimate escape mechanism, though. ++++++++ +Charme+ ++++++++ You know that one chick that's always a theif and can cut you down in just a few seconds? Yeah. Charme's that type of chick. She's not violent, though. Violence is the least of your problems with her. Don't take her to a bar and don't bring her to any kind of knight. Status: Adventurer How to Recruit: Defeat her in Jade Way Have Charme visit the store and chat with Tear Increase your relationship with her via shopping deals Have Charme visit a second time and accept her business card Shopping Times: Noon, Evening, Night Preferred Atmosphere: 3 Dark 4 Gaudy Likes: Charms Daggers Medicines Necklaces Rings Shoes Treasures Budget: Min 3000 Max 300,000 Equips: Daggers Clothes Breastplates Bracelets Hats Charms Capes Shoes Rings Notes: She can run by double-tapping in the direction you want to run. Be careful when doing this, though, since running into an enemy will hurt you and running into a wall will knock you down. She can parry by tapping the direction the attack is coming from. If performed correctly, blue sparks will fly out and the attack will be negated. If you stand next to a chest with her and an exclamation point appears above her head, then the chest is a trap. Use this to your advantage if you need to be really careful. =Skills= [Mirror Image] -------------- Create a shadow image which will mirror all your actions Cost: 5 SP You can create up to 5 clones of yourself with this technique. They'll all disappear after some time has passed, but very useful for when you're pressing the offensive on a group of enemies. [Flame Charge] -------------- Charme charges forward, flame in her hands! Cost: 5 SP As an attack, it's relatively terrible. However, the greatest use of this attack
