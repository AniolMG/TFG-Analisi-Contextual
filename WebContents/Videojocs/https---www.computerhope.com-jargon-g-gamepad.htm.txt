A gamepad is the primary peripheral device used on console gaming systems, like the Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo platforms. Some portable gaming systems have a gamepad built into the gaming device itself, like the Nintendo Switch. Many gamepads are also made to work with a computer, often using a USB (universal serial bus) connection. Some gamepads featuring haptic feedback allow a user to feel action in the game, by vibrating the controller. The first gamepad was introduced in 1985, first by Nintendo, then by Sega, for use with their video gaming systems. Since then, many forms of gamepads have been made and sold, but all still have a similar design. Note The term "game controller" also describes any input device used to play games. Game controllers could include gamepads, joysticks, steering wheels, paddle, and the keyboard and mouse. Related information How to set up or install a joystick or gamepad. Console vs. PC gaming.
