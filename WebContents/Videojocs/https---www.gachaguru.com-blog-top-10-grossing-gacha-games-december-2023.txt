Updated November 2023 Revenue: $53M

After their worst month in revenue, Honkai Star Rail is back up to number 2 with an impressive $26M.
Updated November 2023 Revenue: $19M
Why It's Up: New characters like Argenti, Hanya, Ruan Mei, and Xueyi, plus the Silver Wolf rerun, compensated the low-income month from Huohuo's banner, which featured some of the worst 4-star characters in the game.
