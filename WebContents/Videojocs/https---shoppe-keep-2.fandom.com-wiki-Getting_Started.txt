FANDOM FAN CENTRAL BETA GAMES ANIME MOVIES TV VIDEO WIKIS START A WIKI ADVERTISEMENT SIGN IN REGISTER Shoppe Keep 2 Wiki 44 PAGES EXPLORE WIKI CONTENT COMMUNITY Getting Started 1 SIGN IN TO EDIT When you first start playing the game, you will be prompted to first create a character, and then complete the tutorial. The tutorial of the game will introduce you to some of the basics of the game such as moving around, picking up items, cleaning up your shop, and placing things in your shop. Just follow the prompts that will tell you exactly what to do (note: the management building and your shop are the only accessible buildings in the tutorial. The rest of the town is blocked off by a wagon and some logs. The blockade will not be present in the regular game). Walk into doors to go through them; no need to press E or click anything. When you finish the tutorial you will be able to play the game in single player or multiplayer mode (Note that you can't play multiplayer mode until you have completed the tutorial). Now that you have started, you will have some simple quests to guide you towards making money in your shop and becoming familiar with the town. In the town, you have the Management building which you start in front of. Here you will be able to pay taxes, upgrade your town, and receive your orders for your shop. Your shop itself is located to the left (northwest) of your Management building on top of a small hill. Once you unlock them from the Management building you can also find an Alchemist, a Blacksmith, and a Cook in the town as interactable buildings with NPCs. There's also a furniture vendor that needs no unlocking, which is also part of the first set of quests.

I cannot finish the tutorial because it isn't anywhere. Catsroyer · 3/16/2021 It should be there, it will have a sign on top with the name of your store on top.
