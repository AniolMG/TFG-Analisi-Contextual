Stream your own music files. Build custom playlists. Subscriptions are available for more features. No account necessary. What We Don't Like Shows ads. How to Use YouTube Music YouTube Music is a version of normal YouTube dedicated to streaming songs and music videos. It works like the regular website, but excludes all the non-music content. It's easy to search for music, create playlists, and subscribe to channels for updates when a new song drops. You can find playlists for specific genres, decades, activities, or moods, and categories for kids. YouTube Music also lets you upload your music to listen from anywhere. The site's home page has personal mixes and handy categories; I've seen Mindful instrumentals, Dance Moods, The Holiday Season, All-time essentials, and International Women's Day. I like that I can hide the video; it's a great way to listen without distractions. I'm also a huge fan of the lyrics that I can read for some songs â€” they even show up in line with the music for some tracks. This works from the TV app, too. This site is especially useful if you use it often. I have found so much new music here because I get recommendations based on my playlists and listening history. With a paid subscription, you can listen ad-free, offline, and with your screen off (on mobile). There are individual and family plans.

Available as a mobile app. No skip limit. What We Don't Like Can't share your custom stations. Jango is another free streaming radio service that makes it easy to listen to free music online from a computer, smartphone, or tablet. Beyond the unlimited listening and minimum commercials, what makes this service great is that you can build custom radio stations by simply picking your favorite band or singer. There are also hundreds of pre-made stations you can look through by genre. One neat feature I enjoy using is the variety setting. While playing from any station, adjust the variety meter to teach the site what it should play for you. There's also an edit button where you can choose other artists to add to the station; Jango will play songs by them and other related artists. Visit the trending section to jump to the most popular radio stations like Viral Global Hits, Dance Virality, Indie Life, and The Millennium Bug.

Our Review of Pandora Pandora is a great place to find tracks from your favorite artists, and it's a great place to discover new music. When you search for an artist, genre, or composer, the service creates an online streaming radio station based on what you like. What I appreciate most about using Pandora is that as I listen to custom stations, I'll hear songs and artists similar to those I've already liked. I can then tell Pandora to play more tracks like what I've listening to or to move in a different direction. It lets you make dozens of unique custom stations that contain music that you love. But if you're not even sure where to start, I recommend the Top Stations and Genres page. Premium and Plus are the ad-free, paid versions of Pandora that include features like a desktop program, higher audio quality, offline listening, and more.
