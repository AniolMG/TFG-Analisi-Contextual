Key Takeaways There are a vast array of musical styles and subgenres existing globally. While many people think of popular genres like pop or electronic music when they hear ‚Äúmusic,‚Äù there are numerous lesser-known genres like Cruck or chillwave that are often overlooked. The classification of music into genres and subgenres is complex and often fluid. Many songs may belong to specific subgenres or different genres entirely, which might not be immediately recognizable. The music can be cathegorized by genresand by their time period of origin and regional influences, acknowledging that these genres have evolved over time and vary depending on their region of origin. It is probably some musical genre like pop, electronic, reggaeton‚Ä¶. What is certain is that you will not think of Cruck or chillwave music; or maybe a song of this style sounds in your head, but you do not know that it belongs to a musical genre with such an uncommon name. It is very common that we identify certain songs with a known musical genre without knowing that it probably belongs to a sub-genre called different or even belongs to another genre. This happens for the simple fact that there are so many different musical styles, with their own subgenres and which also vary depending on the region in which they originated, that it is impossible to know them all. Thus, in this article we have decided to bring together, sorted by date of origin as well as by region, the vast majority of currently identified musical genres.
