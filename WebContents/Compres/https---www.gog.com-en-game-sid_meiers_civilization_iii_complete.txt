IMO it is a great Civilization game which just surpasses its sequels for two simple reasons. While deep it is not as complex as 4 and 5 (haven't played 6 as of the writing of this). It doesn't go into religion other than the classic (civ) take on it which is just some buildings deep. I love that. In this game you take command of one of many nations, each with different specialized buildings and units and abilities, from ancient times (4000BC) to the near future. In the turn based format, your goal is to take your nation---->civilization and win the campaign. You can do so in the usual diplomatic, militaristic, etc ways, including the all classic building a spaceship and sending it to Alpha Centauri.

December 13, 2018 Verified owner Be aware that this bundle allows only Conquest version of the game. You can play neither basic civ 3 nor Play the World expansion. This was huge disappointment to me as I'm not a fan of changes made by Conquest. Basically Conquest expansion added huge number of units and buildings without increasing the number of available technologies. As a result it doesn't matter much which technology you choose to develop next as it almost always will give you new unit(s) and new building(s) anyway. What I appreciated the most in civ 3 were choices and risks you made when deciding your research strategy. Especially in Middle Ages when you could basically go two ways (economic & research development or military). Another factor is that Conquest brings several additional wonders. Some of them are IMO Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (107 of 117 users found this helpful) DrLove Games: 951 Reviews: 5 A valiant effort, falling a little short December 1, 2016 Verified owner Civilization III is an excellent game, but more than offering enjoyable gameplay, it serves as an important stepping stone to the later games. It offers unique enough experience that some players will find it more appealing than other titles in this series, but I was left a little unfulfilled playing this. Civ III tried to revamp the gameplay, as known from Civ II. With the success of Alpha Centauri, which managed to revolutionize the Civ concept while still feeling like part of the series, Civ III tried to take the best of AC and apply it here. One of the main features it took was the concept of cultural borders, and consequently cultural victory. Cities produce culture, which in turn generate national borders, within which other nations cannot build their cities. The borders may Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (75 of 89 users found this helpful) Akka Games: 687 Reviews: 15 Flawed but still great December 3, 2016 Verified owner A child of extreme, Civ3 sports both the best and the worst. Bringing the new revolutionaries concepts that would grow through the franchise (like culture, borders, global support of units and so on), Civ3 was truly a revoltion for the serie. At the same time, it suffered from dubious design choices and balancing. Still, at the crossroad between old-school and modern, it's a very great experience and well worth any price. Those wanting only the very best should look at Civ4, but still, Civ3 has an immersive quality and some magic that were unique to it. I would definitely recommend to play it.

I am 20 years old now and i still play this game sometimes, i have 100 hours played on my steam version of CIV3 Complete. The wars are so much funnier than in the sequels you can mass stack units and form a train of invading troops, and when the AI wants a peace treaty you can scam him of even more gold and cities and invade him again. It's broken but fun! There are really good mods for civ3 on civfanatics website. Civ IV is second best and CIV V was awesome aswel but the oldschool graphics and animations are just flawless in CIV3. Anyone who hasn't yet played civ3 should definately give it a chance GOG always makes the best and most compatible versions for games so this Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (53 of 70 users found this helpful) 2 3 ... 8 Written in English Deutsch polski français русский 中文(简体) Others Written by Verified owners Others Added Last 30 days Last 90 days Last 6 months Whenever After release During Early Access Redeem code Contact us Career opportunities Submit your game Blog Language: English Deutsch Français Polski Pусский 中文(简体) Currency: EUR USD Discover GOG Galaxy Legal Privacy policy Our thanks Cookie Declaration Imprint © GOG sp. z o.o.
