In this action-packed, open world, third person action game, you must fight to stay alive in The Wasteland, using brutal on-ground and vehicular against vicious gangs of bandits. A reluctant hero with an instinct for survival, Max wants nothing more than to leave the madness behind and find solace in the storied “Plains of Silence.” Players are challenged with treacherous missions as they scavenge the dangerous landscape for supplies to build the ultimate combat vehicle.

Eurogamer by Martin Robinson Recommended Like Shadow of Mordor before it, Mad Max sees Warner Bros thoughtfully apply its filmic property to an open world. PC Gamer by Christopher Livingston 77/100 Satisfying car combat and a beautiful wasteland mostly make up for repetitive melee combat and lackluster story.

It's nothing incredible, but it's some functional arkham style combat with some exceptional car combat. You won't be blown away, but you'll have a good time with it. One important note I want to make though. This game has one major flaw that I cannot believe hasn't been fixed yet. To my knowledge there's no mods that can fix this. WB Games, Avalanche, if you're reading this, please do something. The convoy assaults are by far and away the best part of the game. And they do not respawn. Once you take out a convoy, it's gone for good. You get an attachment for your car for each one, but you can only equip two at a time. So here's my advice, find a wiki, figure out which two attachments you want, and only complete those convoys. For the other ones, take out most of Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (423 of 447 users found this helpful) Bloodrunsclear Games: 1094 Reviews: 137 Oh What a Lovely Day! March 22, 2021 This is one of the best and most criminally underrated open world games out there. Mad Max isn't just a veneer here on an open world game: this is THE Mad Max experience. You scavenge. You fight wars on the road. You go mad. The world is massive and thankfully quite beautiful in a desolate way, swapping pure desert for a dried ocean which allows for wondrous coral pillars and whale bones in addition to typical ruins and ranges. You're constantly updating your car, your gear, building up bases to improve your odds. There's a lot of side activities like racing and exploration to take up the slack between the absurdly long mission based campaign. Just when you figure you've finished a giant portion of the map Max moves his sights to an entirely different chunk of the world, but you can Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (196 of 206 users found this helpful) grouii Games: 358 Reviews: 4 Great AAA game on linux! March 22, 2021 This game is very fun and work like a dream on linux thank to Feral Interactive. Most of the team that ported games on linux left now, sad. ... I wait for the second opus of this great game... On linux of course ! What a pity that GOG didn't sign with Feral! Anyway for windows gamer, recommended. It's a game in the style of The Witcher, Shadow of Mordor or Assassin creed : open world, multiple quests and clans, some part of RPG as you upgrade your car and loot for more powerful stuffs.

After getting an XBOX One a few years later, the first game I grabbed was Mad Max. After completing it on there, I then bought it on Steam and played through it three more times. Needless to say, I like playing this game. Anyway, onto the review. The driving is a little delayed in steering (in my memory) and the customization is too light for a game that centralizes around automobiles (Midnight Club it is not). These are the main downsides and if you can live with that, the world itself is just cool to wander around in. I ended up building a car that I liked to drive rather than the most effective setup and played through using that. Graphics hold up well (Still looks good on 1080p max on my main Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (51 of 55 users found this helpful) Burzag Games: 1066 Reviews: 34 THX :D March 22, 2021 Verified owner Sometimes you G.O.G. - guys are just the best.
