Cut too slim
17 hours ago
I am so disappointed!! This sweatshirt is cut SO slim and so tight around the hips that it's uncomfortable! I even went and got a medium and it is 4 inches smaller than my older Tek Gear small sweatshirt; which I LOVE!

Beautiful, if you find the right size.
18 hours ago
Beautiful soft shirt but I listened to other comments on the site and ordered up. in size. Big mistake. It was very big when I put it on so I need to return it. When I checked on line they no longer had a smaller size but if I wanted to drive,at 83, to the mall that night on the otherside of Pittsburgh, they only had one available. They couldn't ship it to me so I never found oneto wear. Will return this.

Good buy.....but
a day ago
I recently purchased this sweatshirt in green & pink. The quality is very good, they are cozy & warm but with one caveat. When you wash them, please hand wash or wash with white load. They shed terribly. Everything I had with them in the load was covered with lint balls. Be Careful! I never had trouble with Tek Gear before, but these were a little disappointing.
