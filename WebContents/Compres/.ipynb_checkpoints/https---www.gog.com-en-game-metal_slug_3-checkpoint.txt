I finished this and I didn't see any problem at all with performance. The reason I rate this game 3 stars is because some achievements are not working, I completed the game, I have the achievement of rescue 100 guys, but the achievement of rescue 10 doesn't pop up. I tried many solutions but none helped me. If this problem can be solved, this game is an easy 5 stars.

You'll suffer a lot playing it alone, try to team up with someone else. The gameplay is like every game on the series, which is very good. Buy this and get thousand of hours cool old school gameplay while you die, die, die and die a little more. Worked great here on i7 3770k and 1050ti 4gb. Didn't have any FPS drops, achievements bug or button wrong mapped (you can remap each one).

It comes included with an emulator and the ROM files, as known by MAME and FinalBurnAlpha. This makes it possible to run the game with RetroArch or other emulators and ultimately grants it one or two stars more. The emulator for the Linux version at least, has problems with high display framerates. As I'm using a 144Hz monitor, the game runs at more than double the speed and there is no VSync or framerate option. You can't rebind the controls for keyboard or controller. However, you have the option to control more game settings than in the Steam version of the game. Unfortunately, there is no level select any more. Also there are unskippable splash screens. (Why?!) The game is super fun, although you will die at some times and Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (8 of 9 users found this helpful) NateJennings75 Games: 788 Reviews: 118 Huge Game March 10, 2020 Verified owner Metal Slug 3 throws in everything including the kitchen sink. Wide range of stages and enemy types. Stages have multiple branching paths, sometimes leading to different end bosses. Variety of weapons and vehicles. Great sense of humor. Metal Slug 3's only shortcoming is that it's a tad long. For two controller co-op in the Linux and Mac versions: have 2P press COIN (R Bumper) then START. Works like the old arcades releases of Neo Geo games. Is this helpful to you? yes no (5 of 6 users found this helpful) james5272 Games: 277 Reviews: 17 Great game, terrible port. April 7, 2018 Has some issues, such as some of the music tracks will speed up and slow down for seemingly no reason, and the game has slowdown. When in windowed these issues seemed more prominent, when I went fullscreen the music track issue remained, but most of the slowdown was removed. What slowdown remained seemed to be for legacy reasons, maybe they're wanting to keep it pitch-perfect emulation in that regard for purists, however it doesn't let you toggle difficulties as precisely as you could with the Arcade version (which let you put it on a slider from 1 to 8, in this version it's Easy, Normal, Hard or Very Hard, so only four settings with no indication of which Arcade difficulty each one is), so if the intent was pitch-perfect emulation then there's something to be desired on that front.
