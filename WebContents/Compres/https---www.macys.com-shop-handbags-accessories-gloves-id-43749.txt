Women’s Mittens
When you want to keep your hands warm during the winter, you have lots of choices. Whether you prefer leather gloves, knitted mittens, fingerless, or pop-top options, you’ll find mittens and gloves, all in one place: Macy’s. Here’s more information about how to find a pair of women’s mittens that are right for you.
Different Styles of Women’s Mittens
Traditionally, women’s mittens are designed with a separate thumb and a single space where all the other fingers hang out together. They’re easy to put on and take off. Gloves for women allow for more dexterity (for example, when you’re texting, opening doors, or turning a key). Some people think hybrid pop tops are the best winter mittens. They are essentially fingerless gloves with an attached mitten cover that you can pull on and off as needed. Both pop-top knit and leather mittens come in a wide variety of colors and patterns.
Mix and Match Your Women’s Mittens
As you’re shopping for winter mittens for women, take a moment to consider if you want your women’s winter accessories to match. Macy’s offers separately sold styles that match women’s hats as well as coordinated accessories sold together as sets. If you’ve already bought a pair of women’s boots for the season, you might want to look for mittens that coordinate with them. Or you can pick mittens in the same color as your winter coat. Another thing to keep in mind: leather gloves look dressier, while wool mittens for women provide a more casual vibe.
When it’s time to prep your closet for winter, make Macy’s your destination for cozy mittens and cold-weather accessories.
