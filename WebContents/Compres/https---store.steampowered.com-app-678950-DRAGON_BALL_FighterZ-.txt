I am 27, almost 28...been watching Dragon Ball since I was 6-7 years old on toonami. Not only is DB my favorite, it also opened more doors for more animes. Helped me through bad times when I was addicted to pills (4 years clean now). I don't care what society expects of me, but DB and anime in general will always be apart of my life and made me who I am today. Call it corny, its just pure love I had for this anime. Sleep in heavenly peace and thank you so much for everything you did for me and millions of others, if not billions. I don't really have much family, no friends or social media...so I thought this would be the best place to post this. Raise your hands high and lets give Akira our energy for the last time for massive spirit bomb! <3 READ MORE Was this review helpful?

Yes No Funny Award 39 people found this review helpful Agent Buck$hot 13 products in account 1 review Not Recommended 5.8 hrs on record POSTED: 1 MARCH (Will remove this review when the issues get fixed) Not only did they blueball us by not releasing rollback netcode for years, but when they finally do it's the same beta version that we've tested months before with all the previous bugs still present. If they don't fix these issues, not only is the final nail going in the coffin for FighterZ but they're also gonna kill any & all hype for FighterZ 2. Absolutely unacceptable to treat a playerbase like this that has kept the game alive despite the aforementioned issues, not even mentioning the money spent on all the DLC characters.
