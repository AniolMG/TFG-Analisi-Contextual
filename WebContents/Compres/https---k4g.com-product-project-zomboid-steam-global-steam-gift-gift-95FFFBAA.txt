Truly a zombie apocalypse experience that you can share with your friends or with unknown players on servers, recommended product to be honest. Gameplay Realism Online and mods support Graphics (these are not bad, but they're just not for everybody) angeelmonster2001 17.09.2022 1 Rating: This game stands out as one of the best and most realistic in the zombie genre, particularly in the realm of survival and strategic planning. It can prove challenging for beginners, demanding patience and careful consideration. Unlike other games you may have played before, it offers a unique experience of highs and lows. The lows can be tedious, such as waiting out infections or dedicating real-life time to marginal increases in skill XP through reading. On the other hand, the highs are immensely rewarding, whether it's getting your first car running, collaborating with friends to fend off zombie hordes, acquiring skills in various fields like mechanics, medicine, agriculture, engineering, and carpentry, or constructing the perfect base only to witness it destroyed in unexpected ways. I highly recommend giving it a try and enjoying the diverse experiences this game has to offer. remy_martin 23.11.2023 0 Rating: This game rocks when it comes to zombie survival! Think Dead Island but toss in thirst, hunger, bleeding, broken bones, pain, and even boredom. And get this, it's just 2D graphics, but it'll totally hook you—usually with a side of being eaten. Zidanne89 11.11.2023 0 Rating: The game is fun and great to play with friends. If you want to get humbled then get this game as it'll show you that it's not easy surviving in a zombie apocalypse. Graphics arent for everyone but I definitely recommend the game. danielkhafaf 22.10.2023 0 Rating: King11 07.08.2023 0 1 2 3 ... 15 Trustpilot Offer for you PLATFORM Steam ITEM TYPE (3) Steam Gift REGION (4) Global REGULAR PRICE -65% 13.99 EUR 4.80 EUR VIP Price -79% 13.99 EUR 2.88 EUR Buy with VIP Sunny_game 100% 36669 View all 7 offers from 4.80 EUR Earn 0.24 EUR from referral and many more Want to list?
