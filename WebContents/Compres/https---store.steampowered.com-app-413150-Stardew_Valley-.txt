Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared.

I love the hack and slash thrill from DMC, the gore fest from Doom Eternal, the unbearable challenges of Souls-Like games. My wife introduced me to this game and its a game I didn't know I needed. I deal with a lot of anxiety and PTSD from my military service and other stressors in my life, but there's something about harvesting crops and petting your duck named "Howard" that just feels so relaxing. This game is an escape from the everyday stress and I can't recommend it enough. And it was developed by a one man army?! Like damn this man earned his flowers. READ MORE Was this review helpful?

You can create your own farm and customize it to your liking. I have a small farm in the forest called "Greenwood Farm" and my character is named Henry. You can also walk around town and meet all types of different people. The story is cool. I really recommend Stardew Valley; it is very relaxing and fun. Was this review helpful?

It was one of the first games I ever played on steam. It helped to ground and distract me when I was going through depression and rough patches in my life. I think the charm of the game is its simplicity, beautiful music, relationships with villagers and cute animals. You just seem to slip through time and forget your worries. Beautiful game.

ConcernedApe (or just Ape) has greatly outdone himself with the events, characters, and locations. Couldn't have asked for more. Now with 1.6 nearly here, I can't wait to see what he adds as I'm sure it will make the game more interesting. 10/10 Would definitely recommend Helpful?
