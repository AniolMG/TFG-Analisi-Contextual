Now fly. December 21, 2012 Verified owner I struggled to finish Syberia 1. I practically forced myself to play Syberia 2. At first, I was happy to continue the tale of Kate, Hans and Oscar on their journey towards Syberia. Then about 10 minutes into the actual game, I almost walked away. Hiding crucial puzzle items where you are unlikely to notice them isn't fun. Thankfully, GOG included a walkthrough for those several occasions. Then there are a plethora of WTF moments which I won't spoil for those of you curious to play this. I am willing to accept a mysterious island with mammoths, but some events were just too much. They effectively shattered my immersion in the Syberia world. And a certain event that was supposed to be emotionally engaging was truncated and then defiled moments later. On top of that, the subplot in New York Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (98 of 134 users found this helpful) pgw041 Games: 98 Reviews: 1 Disappointing sequel August 17, 2013 Verified owner I started off liking this game but it wore me down after a while and finishing it was a real chore. While the production values are high, the game has some major flaws in my opinion: * Many of the puzzles are of the trial-and-error variety where you keep on clicking things at random until you hit upon the correct combination; * Some of the actions that have to be carried out to complete parts of the game are, to be frank, ludicrous; * There is no quick way to travel around locations, some of which are quite large, which makes playing the game tedious. The game is certainly very pretty to look at and the story isn't bad but the issues above meant that, for me at least, it wasn't a very enjoyable experience.

I'm wrinting this 'cos both games feel the same to me. I'd loved both. Great story telling, beatiful graphics, simple interfase and almost none pixel hunting. The only thing that bothers me in these games is the time spend in traveling through screens.

A few of the controls & gameplay have been improved upon, and as a direct continuation to the original, you are hooked right away. Do NOT play this until you've completed the original, because the storyline is terrific, and you'd be a bit lost. Plus the storyline of part 1 is just as awesome. Here's cheering for part 3 (Coming, but taking its time) Is this helpful to you? yes no (18 of 23 users found this helpful) jadoon Games: 152 Reviews: 3 Amazing experience #2 January 18, 2015 Verified owner The same as for the first episode. One of the most fantastic point-and-click adventures ever! Great story, brilliant voice acting, unforgotable mood and above all amazing pictures that have unique style. Already looking forward to playing third episode!
