I would normally applaud a large publisher for putting their games, albeit older, up on GOG DRM-free. However, EA requires those that give them money to agree to a very anti-consumer EULA before you are allowed to play the game you paid for. In the EULA, you must agree to allow EA to use information from your computer for their marketing and advertisement as well as allow public display of such information. Any creations are theirs among other one sided regulations including agreeing to binding arbitration, waiving a right to a jury and forgoing any class action representation. You must also agree to both their privacy policy and second online terms of service agreement neither explicitly outlined, but hyperlinked to Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (2095 of 2213 users found this helpful) lordofkrikkit Games: 106 Reviews: 15 Purchase -> Pirate -> Play September 23, 2016 So this is the game that officially caused me to switch from Steam to GoG. I purchased it for $30 US two years ago on Steam, downloaded it, installed it, and tried to play it. Was told *after* game launch via prompt that to play I was first *required* to register on the Spore developer's website. I tried to, and found the website was down and had been for some time. I filled out a Trouble Ticket on Steam, the sole means of contact that company has, and after a week of no response, contacted my bank. *My bank* tried to contact Steam, and after a week of no response, gave me a full refund, deeming the charge fraudulent. After this, Steam contacts me - one "Robbie" from Tech Support. Robbie informs me that Steam doesn't offer refunds, and told me to work things out with the game Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (825 of 1128 users found this helpful) sgardham Games: 38 Reviews: 1 finally Spore is DRM free September 22, 2016 8 years later, Spore is officially DRM free! Though the game is more interesting in the early stages, there are a lot of customization options, unfortunately for me the gameplay later on lacks a certain something, I cannot pinpoint exactly what it is. The later stages of the game feel rushed and the whole game leaves me with a sense of uneven, unbalanced gameplay evolution. But maybe that's just me.

Your goal in Spore is to raise an alien race from single-cell organism all the way to galactic empire. This is achieved in the different phases: the Pac-man like Cell phase, the third-person RPG inspired Creature phase, the mini-RTS Tribal stage, the full-blown RTS Civilization stage, and the heavily Starflight and Star Control inspired Space stage. You flesh out your creatures appearance in the Creature stages while fleshing their mentality and behavior through all stages. Sadly the Space stage is the only phase you will normally come back to, as satisfying it is to go through all stages it can also be tedious. That said the Space phase is the closest part of the Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (234 of 284 users found this helpful) Vlaxitov Games: 15 Reviews: 1 Great Game But Not For Everyone September 22, 2016 Verified owner This is the kind of game that is only as good as you are at it. If you have an imagination and you're good at very basic 3d modeling Spore will offer you a lot of replay value. The strength of this game isn't the actual game rather than tools that allow you to be creative with the game to make your own galaxy of creatures and civilizations. If you don't have much of an imagination nor the patience/ability to work with very basic 3d modeling, you're going to hate this game because that's really the majority of what it offers.
