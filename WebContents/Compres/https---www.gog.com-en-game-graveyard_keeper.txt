Build and manage your own graveyard, and expand into other ventures, while finding shortcuts to cut costs. Use all the resources you can find. After all, this is a game about the spirit of capitalism, and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. And it’s also a love story. Face ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper burger meat for the witch-burning festival, when you have so many resources lying around? Gather valuable materials and craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business. Help yourself - gather the valuable resources scattered across the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. Quests and corpses. These dead bodies don't need all those organs, do they? Why not grind them up and sell them to the local butcher? Or you can go on proper quests, you roleplayer. Explore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without those! Take a trip into the unknown, and discover new alchemy ingredients -- which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers.

In fact, if the developer fails to put in a lot more effort past this date and you're reading this review from a future where exactly that happens, I just can't recommend Graveyard Keeper and I'm writing this negative review as a reflection on the state it was released in. Buyer beware! As of the 18th of August 2018, there's : - Dialogue with NPC's and descriptive text for skills is sometimes missing and results in awkward references to files within the text.

Many called the game "unfinished". I'm very happy to say that after several months and A LOT of patches, the game feels absolutely great. There have been many gameplay elements added over time, like alchemy or making zombies (!!!). Overall its gameplay is somewhat similar to Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon or any other "farm simulator" game, but there's enough unique twists to make it shine. It gives many diverse goals for a player to achieve and hours of nice, dark fun. Many nights I realised that it's 3am suddenly and I've been playing this game since 8pm. Huge "just one more day" syndrome. Overall, as of "Breaking Dead" update, it was one of the best "farm simulators" I've ever played.

This game is tailor-made to address your weirdly specific crtiticisms. The gameplay is like some mirror-universe twin of the Stardew/Harvest Moon genre, exhect instead of framing you're burying (or digging up) dead people. There's much more focus on doing tasks for other people, at least in the early game, so it has more direction than Stardew et. al., but the stamina depletion problem is pretty bad in the early game and I'm not sure if it ever gets better, or you just become able to afford more food to stuff you face with to alleviate it. Technically it seems so run alright. I've only seen one problem so far and it was when I was talking to a villager and the game seemed to auto-skip all of Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (122 of 150 users found this helpful) harryarchere Games: 8 Reviews: 1 Unfinished, yet holds promise August 17, 2018 Verified owner A lot of people who have been spoiled by Stardew Valley are expecting this game to be very similar, and for good reason. The artwork looks similar, the gameplay mechanics are similar, but the amount of grinding required is far more. This game could be the Dark Souls of Stardew Valley. Reviewing this game of its own merit, I personally am enjoying the amount of work to be done in the game to do tasks. There are several places where dialing the difficulty down would be appreciated, but in my opinion it adds character to the game. There is quite some content to the game and holds potential for lot more. The experience is definitely enjoyable barring the impending dread that something might stop working or bug out. The game is severely buggy.

The setting is fun; the subject matter is darkly humorous and is the strongest aspect of the game. After that much of a time sink, I really thought there were a few huge flaws that could have made the game more enjoyable. First of all, this is a grindfest only for those who are seriously into that grind. Long production chains with MANY intermediary steps requiring travel across the map for a slow payout. The game forces you to become a jack of all trades since many of the production chains are interlinked with other disciplines but I really only found the gravekeeping/priesthood to be Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (76 of 92 users found this helpful) 2 3 ... 24 Written in English Deutsch polski français русский 中文(简体) Others Written by Verified owners Others Added Last 30 days Last 90 days Last 6 months Whenever After release During Early Access Redeem code Contact us Career opportunities Submit your game Blog Language: English Deutsch Français Polski Pусский 中文(简体) Currency: EUR USD Discover GOG Galaxy Legal Privacy policy Our thanks Cookie Declaration Imprint © GOG sp. z o.o.
