RCT then came along, thanks to Chris Sawyer who pretty much made the whole game with a hired graphics artist. What he came up with was a touch of genius. Everything that was present in Theme Park is in the game and with so much more added. You start with one of the scenarios whereby a typical scenario could start off with a fairly developed park or one that requires you to almost build from scratch. After meeting the requirements, you successfully complete the scenario and unlock the next ones. To meet requirements, you build your park up. Like in Theme Park, you start off by laying paths, Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (388 of 405 users found this helpful) midaku Games: 105 Reviews: 1 one of the best on GoG now February 11, 2013 Verified owner calling this one of the most enjoyable+addictive games in existence is the understatement of the year; I yearn for a game as balanced, compelling, casual, and challenging all at the same time, as this is... and ONLY 5.99 on here, complete&DRM free... just amazing. some of the games here on GoG are variably good after aging, but this one truly holds up over the years; It's a masterpiece and a ride I'm more than willing to take again :) Is this helpful to you? yes no (164 of 182 users found this helpful) Keymonk Games: 159 Reviews: 2 One of the best sims I've played July 7, 2011 Verified owner This is easily one of the best sims I've ever played in my life.

A very addictive game for those who want to know how it feels to own an amusement park. I still remember my parents trying to pry me from the computer after playing this past my limit. Very fun and educational game. Taught me how to manage my money properly. Also taught me that there are a lot of people out there who can't swim...

It has a few small blemishes, mostly related to lining things up vertically in a faux-3D environment. None of these matter, because Roller Coaster Tycoon is pure fun. The game imposes just enough challenge to keep you building and fleshing out your park without feeling like you're struggling against artificial deadlines. It's easy to complete a 3 year goal in the first year, then spend hours continuing to build the park to match your vision of it. Watching long lines form at your exciting custom coaster is more satisfying than any financial reward. The coasters' very real physics make this a true sandbox game even without the park's large assortment of other features. A wealth of scenery and ride options are available to enable Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (60 of 64 users found this helpful) 2 3 ... 32 Written in English Deutsch polski français русский 中文(简体) Others Written by Verified owners Others Added Last 30 days Last 90 days Last 6 months Whenever After release During Early Access Redeem code Contact us Career opportunities Submit your game Blog Language: English Deutsch Français Polski Pусский 中文(简体) Currency: EUR USD Discover GOG Galaxy Legal Privacy policy Our thanks Cookie Declaration Imprint © GOG sp. z o.o.
