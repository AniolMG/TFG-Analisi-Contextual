The Blade is designed for modern and aggressive play and offers a lot of control for attacking players. This racket weighs 286 grams and requires the necessary technique from the player, but gives a lot of precision and feeling in return. The handleweight balance point of 330 mm offers a lot of ball control and the right maneuverability which makes the racket also great to use at the net. The medium racket blade of 645 cm2 gives more speed to the ball and offers a good mix of power and control.Applied TechnologiesThe racket is equipped with the new Feelflex technology. This technology offers increased flexibility and stability of the racket, allowing you to generate more power and experience better control when returning the ball. The BLX technology in the frame makes the racket lighter and stiffer for more power and less vibration. As a result, mis-hit balls are corrected more often and better, allowing the player to enjoy more power and playing comfort.
