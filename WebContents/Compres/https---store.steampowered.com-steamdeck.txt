Brighter colors, blacker blacks Steam Deck’s HDR OLED display is designed from the ground up for gaming, with striking contrast, brilliant clarity, and a larger picture. With more colors, pure blacks, and amazing motion rendition, you’ll see your games in a new light. More time to play Steam Deck OLED has 30-50% more battery life. We fit a bigger battery into the case, and the OLED display draws less power. Add in an updated, more efficient AMD APU and you have way more time to play your favorites. Faster downloads Steam Deck OLED comes with Wifi 6E, offering increased bandwidth and lower latency. This means faster downloads (up to 3 times faster!) and stable online play. Lighter, cooler Thanks to a bigger fan and updated thermals, Steam Deck OLED runs cooler. It weighs 30g, or ~5% lighter than the LCD model, due to the screen. Learn more about Steam Deck OLED Steam Deck Features All Steam Decks (both LCD and OLED) are powerful, portable, PC gaming devices made for comfort and a console-like experience. Portability meets power We partnered with AMD to create Steam Deck's custom APU, optimized for handheld gaming. It is a Zen 2 + RDNA 2 powerhouse, delivering more than enough performance to run the latest AAA games in a very efficient power envelope. Your Steam Library, anywhere Once you've logged into Steam Deck, your entire Steam Library shows up, just like any other PC. You'll also see the compatibility rating of each game, indicating the kind of experience you can expect when playing. You can dynamically filter any view in your library by compatibility rating if you're looking for specific sorts of experiences. See verified games Check your library's compatibility Control with comfort The Steam Deck was built for extended play sessions—whether you're using thumbsticks or trackpads—with full-size controls positioned perfectly within your reach. The rear of the device is sculpted to comfortably fit a wide range of hand sizes. Console-like experience Steam Deck has a user-friendly interface specifically designed for its gamepad controls. Its software and operating system are tailored for Steam Deck, making it the easiest way to get into PC gaming.

The 256GB Steam Deck LCD (new entry level model) is the same Steam Deck 256GB we are shipping today - there are no changes other than price. We will continue supporting this model (and all existing Steam Deck LCD models) with software updates moving forward. Is there a reservation queue if you run out of Steam Decks? Yes, if we should run out of stock for a specific model, we will switch to a reservation queue and customers will receive invitations to purchase in the order that they entered the queue. That said, we will be refreshing inventory of Steam Deck regularly, and do not foresee long queue times like we saw with the Steam Deck LCD launch. Are there any quantity limits when purchasing Steam Deck OLEDs? At launch we are restricting purchases to 1 model of Steam Deck OLED per customer per week. We plan to relax this restriction once we are confident we can meet demand. Will replacement parts be available? Yes, we will be working with iFixit again to provide replacement parts and repair guides for Steam Deck OLED. Will all of my accessories for Steam Deck still work with Steam Deck OLED? Yes, there is no difference in accessory compatibility between Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED. Why wasn't the Limited Edition Steam Deck OLED available in my region? Steam Deck Limited Edition was an experiment for our team, and we were only able to make a small quantity of units. We will continue to explore more colorways and hope to ship more options in the future.
