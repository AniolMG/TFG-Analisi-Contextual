Players can play as who they want, how they want, and with whomever they want in this sequel to the much acclaimed and tremendously successful Saints Row. Set years after the original, the player finds himself in a Stilwater both familiar and strange and challenged with bringing the Saints back as the rightful kings of Stilwater and bringing vengeance to those who wronged him. Limitless Customization - Play as fully customizable characters that are male, female or something in between. Vehicles can be visually customized as well as performance tuned. Cribs and even gangs all have an amazing degree of detailed customization options. Multiplayer - Co-op full story campaign has seamless integration (for example one player drives while the other shoots). Competitive MP pushes the boundaries of immersion in a living Stillwater environment fully populated with police, innocent bystanders and rival gangs. Killer Combat and Awesome Vehicles - Planes, helicopters, motorcycles, boats and cars can be piloted and used as weapons. On the ground new combat options include melee, fine aim, and human shield. Freedom to Explore - More missions, activities, diversions, races, weapons, vehicles, cribs, city districts, and interiors than ever before. Over 40 story missions with additional bonus missions take place in a transformed Stilwater that is over 50% larger than before.

May 12, 2015 Verified owner In my oppinion, this is the best game of the series. Three gangs to fight at your leisure and pace, Much side activities, Over the top story. Freedom! BUT: Technically it runs like crap, if the game is defragmented on your HD, and the car handling is beyond awfull. But, load this and install it: http://www.moddb.com/mods/gentlemen-of-the-row. This fixes the car handling, beside some other problems. And install this game on your fastest HD in your possession, because the game istself loads small chunks from the HD every time, so it does not matter how high end your PC is. Your HD and the defragmentation of the games are the only thing that matters. And under NO circumstances play the german censored version. It will make you hate all people who messed with video games in the Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (200 of 249 users found this helpful) Emerald_Child Games: 589 Reviews: 7 Amazingly FUN But Needs Tweaks First January 24, 2019 Verified owner I bought this game during the 2018 Winter Sale, but didn't play it until the next month. First impression is that this is NOT play-ready out of the box. It was running too fast but also had choppy animations and controls were so wonky that it was difficult to move my character around, especially in a vehicle. But I didn't want to give up on it as I could see that this would be a good game to play if I can just tweak it somehow. There is a popular suite of mods called Gentlemen of the Row, but I wanted to play it as plain vanilla as possible for my first playthrough. I will add the full suite later when I finish it the first time. Anyway, I added 3 mods (google for them, they work great!): 1. Saints Row Powertools - fixes the speed bug; 2. SR2 FPS Unlocker - removes the 30 fps cap for Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (67 of 70 users found this helpful) trusteft Games: 1924 Reviews: 112 Great game, yes the PC version too May 11, 2015 Verified owner I played it to completion 2 times on the Xbox 360 and then I got it for the PC on another store, planning on getting it here too DRM free. First of all, any low frame rate at some points, is the same but worse on the Xbox. and thankfully does not affect the game at all. I am not going to spend any more on that. Now, the actual game. It's a third person action game with shooting, melee fighting, driving, piloting parts. You do a lot of them and with the mouse it's a breeze. It's very similar to the 3D GTA games, though at least for me, it surpasses them in that it never stops being fun. I like the GTA games but I never finished one simply because I got bored several hours in, or in the rare case I found a mission impossible to complete. I never had this happen to me with SR2 (or the Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (96 of 132 users found this helpful) KoreaBeat Games: 782 Reviews: 1 Much better port makes for decent game May 15, 2015 Verified owner I already had this game on Steam, but that version was close to unplayable due to lag, very jumpy framerate, and poor car handling. I installed the Gentlemen of the Row mod but it made no difference. This on a system where Bioshock 2 and Far Cry 2 play great. Rest assured that the GOG release is vastly improved. I no longer suffer from lag or jumpy framerates, and car handling is better as well. It's still not perfect by any means -- draw distance feels short, driving is not great, especially in police cars, and melee aiming is not easy. I am playing with keyboard and mouse. Overall, this is now a pretty decent open-world game, but it's still the case that Saints Row 3 looks far better, plays far better, and is funnier.
