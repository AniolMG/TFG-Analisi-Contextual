I first bought it in retail in 2008, then again on Steam (this time the Enhanced Edition) in 2009, and again, recently on GOG.com, CDProjekt’s sister company. Why three times? Simply put, I wanted to support an independent studio that catered to their players’ needs in an era where publishers dictate terms to please investors instead. I completed The Witcher four times in its entirety. I was seduced by its engrossing storytelling qualities, the mature feel of the game and its unusual take on combat mechanics and gameplay (such as Read more Is this helpful to you? yes no (2416 of 2763 users found this helpful) julianomg Games: 4 Reviews: 1 Thank you from Brazil :) May 12, 2011 Even in Brazil where piracy is much the vast, majority are buying the game, and this to show that all the effort that was deposited in the game bring to artists the reward deserved.Thank you very much CD Projekt RED ,for believing in the pc players.

Overhyping games has become the norm, and usually, it leads to horrible disappointment. I think Oblivion really broke the dam, as from there on everything went downhill in free fall. Dragon Age 2, anyone? Not so with this one. Though the development of the Witcher 2 wasn't exactly hype-free, most of it seemed to focus on GOG's bold move to release the game without DRM. I love GOG, and so I got it from here, although I'd rather put the physical box beside the first one (easily one of the best packages ever). There's the minor annoyance of only getting patches when registered, but really - you DID buy the game, right? But being DRM-free isn't the Witcher's main selling point, it's the game itself.

I was following the development of this game since the beggining, wishing it like crazy, reading every possible news about it. And I already have the first game that is one of the best games I have ever played, so it was impossible to not buy this one too, specially knowing that I'll have just to install it, without getting annoyed by stupid DRM things. Congratulations CD Projekt, you guys really know how to stimulate your clients.
