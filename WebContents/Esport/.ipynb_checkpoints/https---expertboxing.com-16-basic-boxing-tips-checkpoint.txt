These boxing tips will improve your boxing training, boxing punching, and boxing defense. Good luck! TRAINING TIPS: Stay calm and punch lighter on the bag so you can last more rounds, keep your form together, and punch sharp. This will allow you to get in more minutes of quality bagwork. You want to have energy to hit the bag with correct form and keep your punches snappy, instead of spending most of your bagwork panting and huffing to show that you have “heart”. Don’t waste energy showing off on the bag – nobody cares. Don’t workout till complete failure. Get tired, break a sweat, and just push yourself a little more each day. If you go until failure everyday of the week without a reason, you’ll probably overtrain and quit boxing very soon. Drink lots of water. One cup every hour minimum! Make friends in the gym, be humble, and ask people for boxing tips. When another boxer beats you, ask him how he did it; you may be surprised at how helpful he might be at showing you your own weaknesses. PUNCHING TIPS: Turn your whole body into the punch. If your feet are slow, (most people have slow feet at first) you will find that punching a little slower actually hits harder than punching faster. So in other words, punch as fast as your body can turn so you won’t sacrifice power. Again, use your whole body instead of just the arms to punch. Throw short hooks, short uppercuts, and short rights but long jabs. You don’t always have to throw one knockout punch after another. Combo light and hard punches and use head movement to fake out your opponent. Remember that the harder you try, they harder they will counter, and the harder you will get hurt. Calm down and throw the hard punches when you know they’ll land. Never forget to go to the body. Try a jab to the head, and right hand to the body. When you’re in real close, lean your head inside to smother him and throw 2-3 body punches. Throw 3-5 punch combos maximum. You don’t need 10-punch combos – all those do is sap your energy and leave you open to counters. Don’t even practice these for now. Breathe out when you punch and always look at your target when you punch. Don’t hold your breath and don’t look at the ground. Learn to keep your eyes open during the heat of the battle! Let your hands go! Don’t wait around forever to let your opponent hit you all day. Throw something even if it doesn’t land. Keep him thinking and keep your eyes open for more punching opportunities. DEFENSE TIPS: Stay calm and never stop breathing. If you’re starting to panic, ask the other guy to slow down so your mind and body can catch up. Hold your hands high, elbows low, and move your head. Don’t waste energy running around the ring, just take one step and pivot out of the way if your opponent is overly aggressive. Think of yourself as a matador pivoting out of the way as the bull misses. Don’t forget to hit him back. Don’t lean back and don’t take your eyes off your opponent when you’re taking punches (this is especially hard for most beginners). Establish your ground and defend it with hard counters. Pivot so that you don’t get countered. Don’t always wait for your opponent to finish punching before you start punching back. Interrupt his combos and hit him! Too many speedy fighters get caught up in trying to block all the oncoming punches that they never get to counter. Let your hands go! Did you learn something? SHARE IT!

I’d like to know a little bit more about the reasons why not to train until complete failure.. And by the way, the tips helped me a lot, especially the 7th on punching.. Keep up the great tips! =] REPLY Johnny N August 22, 2009 at 1:28 pm why not to train till complete failure The problem with training to complete failure is because of the way that most beginners get there. They don’t get there by slow consistent workouts. They do it by trying too hard, overcommitting on their punches, and wasting their energy pushing the bag instead of hitting it with quick snappy punches. These beginners in a sense, are trying to achieve fatigue faster by wasting energy even faster. Ultimately, they’re building up bad habits that would hurt their fighting abilities in the ring and decrease their ability to improve as a boxer.

This may sound like a dumb question, Im new to actually doing the sport, what do mean by “piviot so you dont get countered”? I get the not getting countered part, but a little confused on how to pivot. REPLY Johnny N September 22, 2010 at 6:00 pm How to pivot To pivot means to keep your front foot down while you’re swing your back foot clockwise or counter-clockwise. Pivoting it better than running away because it allows you to turn your body while still being in range to punch. If you try to back-step, it takes more energy and you still might get hit if you don’t do it fast enough. Taking a back-step is also not favorable because you might jump back too far out of range and not be able to land your own counter-punches. Pivoting turns your whole body and puts you at a different angle and takes you out of the path of the punch. REPLY Will F September 16, 2017 at 12:37 am I’d like to give an option that may help. I don’t mean to but in. But maby try this take some type of tape and make an + on the floor and use that to help u learn pivots. And what I did was start at one end of the tape get in my stance take two steps in and pivot take two steps out then back in and pivot. I did both clockwise and counter clockwise.keep ur front toe pointed out and pivot REPLY cj September 26, 2010 at 9:52 am sparing for starters I’m new. on the heavy bag I can throw these very devastating punches that would be a ko punch but it seems when sparing i cant throw them cause i have no no opening so I’m forced to throw jabs or 1,2s and it seems that i don’t have the reach. also I’m fourteen sparring with 20 year old’s. REPLY dylan December 19, 2020 at 3:46 am you are 24 now big man! REPLY Naveen February 6, 2024 at 11:58 pm and now he’s pushing 30. crazy how time flies REPLY Johnny N September 26, 2010 at 10:23 am how to find openings Yes. That’s a very common problem. The heavy bag never blocks so every one of your exciting punches will land. And then you face a real boxer and nothing seems to get in. Against a real opponent, the jab is going to be your way to finding an opening. You have to use that jab everywhere on his body to try and pry something opening. Only then can you land the right hand. For a beginner boxer, the left hook will never seem to reach. My advice to you, spend less time on the heavy bag and more time on the double-end bag. Do more shadowboxing. REPLY jackalto October 14, 2010 at 7:02 pm boxing this was very helpfull just wondering have you got a good work out plan week by week you could share? REPLY Johnny N October 16, 2010 at 8:54 am boxing workout plans @jackalto I’m coming up with that next. They’re very hard to do since everybody has different goals for workout plans whether it be weight loss, pro fight, amateur fight, or just staying sharp.

REPLY Johnny N November 24, 2010 at 6:54 pm fatal mistakes Awesome question, mrnumber4, I’ll make that my next article! REPLY powerade : February 15, 2011 at 6:02 pm gym i definitely agree on asking other boxers for tips…. i once met this 10 yr old kid that was giving me tips on my guard/covering up and they turned out to be useful in the ring REPLY Johnny N February 17, 2011 at 12:47 pm @powerade – hahaha! Some kids are just so natural at this stuff. I’ll have to admit, too: just the other day, I really liked how this 12-year old kid was moving around the heavy bag so I asked him to show me. I spent the following 2 days practicing it at home. I don’t care that it’s not perfect, I
