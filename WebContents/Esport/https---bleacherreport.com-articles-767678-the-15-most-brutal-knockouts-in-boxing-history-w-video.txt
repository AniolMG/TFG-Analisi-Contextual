Boxing's rich history is full of great fights that were toe-to-toe brawls that go the distance and give the fans a full 10-to-12 rounds of action. But one thing can satisfy the fans more than any other that is a brutal knockout ending a fight in bone-crushing style. Here are the 15 most brutal knockouts in boxing's rich history. If you have a weak stomach please don't watch. 15. Earnie Shavers vs. Jimmy Ellis 1 OF 15 On June 18, 1973 at Madison Square Garden in New York, Earnie Shavers put his punching power on full display for all to see and left Jimmy Ellis knocked out and convulsing. Shavers entered the fight with an impressive record of 45-2, 32 wins in a row and with 44 of the 45 coming by way of knockout. With this vicious knockout, one could see why he had an 97 percent knockout-to-win ratio entering the fight. 14.Nonito Donaire vs. Fernando Montiel 2 OF 15 Nonito Donaire made quick work of Fernando Montiel, knocking him out in the second round of their WBC and WBO bantamweight title fight at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. Donaire rifled off 24 wins in a row after suffering a loss in his second professional fight and showed the boxing community he is indeed a force to be reckoned with, winning the WBC and WBO titles from the equally dangerous Fernando Montiel. By the looks of the aftermath, things could have been much worse for Montiel, as he went into what almost looked like a seizure before being helped to to his feet. 13. Buster Douglas vs. Mike Tyson 3 OF 15 One of the biggest upsets in boxing history took place at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan on Febuary 11, 1990, when Buster Douglas—a 42-1 underdog—knocked out the previously unbeaten ( 37-0, 33 KO's) "Iron" Mike Tyson in the 10th round of the heavyweight championship fight. Douglas went on to lose his next fight to Evander Holyfield and never was a serious factor in the boxing world ever again. He will forever be remembered for his stunning upset of one of boxing's greatest fighters. 12. Mike Weaver vs. John Tate 4 OF 15 Mike Weaver delivered a huge knockout over John Tate at an improbable time during their fight at the Stokley Athletics Center in Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 21, 1980. The powerful blow came at the end of the 15th and final round of their heavyweight fight—making the knockout all the more impressive, considering it came after grueling 14 rounds of action. We will never witness a spectacle like this again since the longest a boxing match can go now is 12 rounds. 11. Roy Jones Jr. vs. Montell Griffin II 5 OF 15 Roy Jones Jr. delivered a quick first round knockout of Montell Griffin on August 7, 1997 at the Foxwoods Resort in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Jones Jr. came into the fight with revenge on his mind, suffering his first professional loss after being disqualified against Griffin five months earlier for hitting Griffin while he was down on his knees. Jones Jr. made sure he showed the boxing world that it was just a minor bump in the road at the prime of his career and went on to win 15 fights in a row before suffering another loss. 10. Kermit Cintron vs. Walter Dario Mathyesse 6 OF 15 On July 14, 2007, Kermit Cintron gave Walter Dario Mathyesse the punch of a lifetime when he knocked Mathyesse out in Round 2 of their bout held at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. Cintron dominated this short-lived fight and ended it with a devastating left, then a right hand for good measure after knocking down Mathyesse two times before in the fight. 9. Glen Johnson vs. Roy Jones Jr. 7 OF 15 Roy Jones Jr. was on the opposite side of the knockout on September 25, 2004, at the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tennessee. Glen Johnson knocked Jones Jr. out cold in Round 9 of their 12 round fight. Coming on the heels of Jones Jr's first loss in 15 fights to Antonio Tarver, Johnson delivered a solid right to the side of Jones Jr's head knocking him out, leaving him lying on the mat unconscious for a few minutes after the fight was called. 8. Lennox Lewis vs. Hasim Rahman 8 OF 15 Lennox Lewis gave Hasim Rahman just what he gave him in their first fight: a knockout loss on November 17, 2001 at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. Lewis first won a battle in court to obtain his immediate rematch against Rahman, as Rahman tried to land another opponent for his first title defense. Lewis went on to defend his title two more times after beating Rahman before calling it a career, beating Mike Tyson and Vitali Klitschko—both by KO victory. 7. Manny Pacquiao vs. Ricky Hatton 9 OF 15 Manny Pacquiao delivered the best knockout of his career against the once un-knockoutable Ricky Hatton, on May 2, 2007 at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. Pacquiao knew he had to put on an impressive display against Hatton after Mayweather knocked Hatton out and delivered an even more impressive fashion, knocking Hatton out in Round 2 as opposed to Mayweather's 10th round knockout a year and a half earlier. Hatton came into the fight winning straight victories after being knocked out and losing for the first time in his career against Mayweather. This was Hatton's last fight as a professional, as he since retired from the sport. 6. Gerry Cooney vs. Ken Norton 10 OF 15 Taking place on March 11, 1981 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Gerry Cooney delivered a fast and disturbing knockout of Ken Norton, knocking him out in Round 1. Cooney's destructive series of punches left Norton out cold, ending up being the last fight of Norton's career. Cooney went on to lose to Larry Holmes by TKO, blowing his only shot at a title in his career. His career lasted only five more fights in which he won three, but lost his final two fights—knocked out by George Foreman in his last fight. 5. Michael Spinks vs. Mike Tyson 11 OF 15 Mike Tyson gave us a knockout to remember on June 27, 1988 when he knocked out Michael Spinks at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City. Tyson barreled his way into the fight defending his titles seven straight times—five of them by KO. Spinks came into the fight with a perfect record of 31-0, 21 of those wins by knockout, and was heralded by many people as the legitimate champion—even though Tyson held all the belts. Tyson was the first and last person to knock down and out Spinks, as well as the first person to ever beat Spinks in his 32 professional bouts. Spinks retired after the fight. Tyson went on to defend his titles just two more times before his infamous knockout loss to Buster Douglas in 1990. 4. Ray Mercer vs. Tommy Morrison 12 OF 15 Ray Mercer handed Tommy Morrison a vicious series of punches knocking him out in dramatic fashion on October 18, 1991 at the Convention Center in Atlantic City. Both fighters came into the fight with undefeated records. Mercer(17-0) was fresh off his victory against Francesco Damiani giving him the WBO heavyweight title. Morrison came in winning 28 fights in a row (23 by knockout). Morrison was out-classed and out-punched in the fight and never really gave Mercer much of a fight. 3. David Tua vs. John Ruiz 13 OF 15 David Tua knocked out John Ruiz with thunderous authority on March 16, 1996, during their WBC international heavyweight title fight held at the Convention Center in Atlantic City. Tua, 22-0 at the time of the fight, came out with the intention of knocking Ruiz (25-2 at the time of the fight) out and did so in quick fashion ending the fight in 19 seconds. Tua caught Ruiz with a powerful left then landed a succession of punches knocking Ruiz out. Adding insult to injury, as Ruiz fell to the canvas, Tua caught Ruiz with a ripping left hand further sending Ruiz into an unconscious state. 2. Arturo Gatti vs. Joey Gamache 14 OF 15 The late, great Arturo Gatti knocked out Joey Gamache in convincing fashion during their fight held at Madison Square Garden in New York City on February 26, 2000. Gatti was known for his brawling style and knockout abilities that he enforced on Gamache in the second round of their fight, laying Gamache out with a left-right-left combo. Gamache was out on his feet and making the knockout worse for Gamache, his head bounced off the ring. The fight ended up being Gamache's last fight, as he suffered brain damage from the knockout. Gamache attributed it to Gatti putting on 19 pounds since they weighed-in the day before and took Gatti to court but lost his case. 1. Julian Jackson vs. Herol Graham 15 OF 15 Julian Jackson took care of Herol Graham in spectacular fashion during their WBC middleweight title fight on November 24, 1990 at the Torrequebrada Hotel and Casino in Benalmadena, Andalucía, Spain. The devastating blow left Graham unconscious for around five minutes after he hit the canvas. The right hand that took him out knocked him out instantly, then he took a vicious blow from the ring when his head bounced violently off the canvas laying him out. With the pure one-shot power, and the horrific head bounce Graham took, this in my opinion is the most brutal knockout in boxing history.
