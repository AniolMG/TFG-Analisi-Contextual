หน้าแรก ความรู้ สินค้า เครือข่ายกรีนเนท เกี่ยวกับเรา EN An Introduction to Home Gardening Principles and Background Home gardening is a simple but very effective way for individuals to make a difference that immediately contributes to their quality of life and also to the world in general through reducing their environmental footprint. Many fresh vegetables and fruit can be produced in gardens, large and small, throughout the community. Wide scale adoption of home gardening would contribute to decentralising the supply of this fresh food, lead to sequestering carbon from local organic matter such as tree prunings, and recycling nutrients such as those in food waste. It would also give consumers some control over their food supply and in many cases gardening would also provide personal relaxation and satisfaction. In this course, we hope to give an opportunity for people to learn basic gardening skills that would help them discover the power and joy of providing fresh home grown vegetables for family and friends. Objectives and Methodology To teach participants how to establish and manage a home vegetable garden using sustainable organic methods. This will be done using presentations and practical activities so they understand fundamental principles as well as gain the confidence through hands-on participation to establish their own gardens. It will include the following topics: 1) Designing a garden and garden preparation prior to planting vegetables. 2) Learning basic concepts about soil. 3) Understanding some plant and soil relationships. 4) Making and preparing biochar and compost – soil conditioners to support a healthy garden. 5) Choosing and applying fertilisers, and plant watering. 6) Choosing which vegetables to grow and what you need to know to grow them well, e.g. crop rotations within the garden.
